Is there a round-up somewhere?\"\\n\\n\"Looks that-a way,\" said Mac, grabbing a soiled cloth with an air of\\ndecision, and giving the pine counter a vigorous rub. At best, he was a\\nman of few words, and the few were generally to the point; yet his\\nquestioner did not seem to notice the noncommittal nature of the reply,\\nand, after an amused glance at the industrious Mac, quitted the store as\\nswiftly as he had entered it. But he flung an explanatory word over his\\nshoulder:\\n\\n\"Guess I\\'ll see to that plug myself--he\\'s fallen lame.\"\\n\\nThen John Darien Power swung out again into the vivid sunshine of\\nColorado (\"vivid\" is the correct adjective for sunshine thereabouts in\\nJune about the hour of the siesta) and gently encouraged a dispirited\\nmustang to hobble on three legs into the iron-roofed lean-to which\\nserved as a stable at \"MacGonigal\\'s.\" Meanwhile, the proprietor of the\\nstore gazed after Power\\'s retreating figure until neither man nor horse\\nwas visible. Even then, in an absent-minded way, he continued to survey\\nas much of the dusty surface of the Silver State as was revealed\\nthrough the rectangle of the doorway, a vista slightly diminished by the\\nroof of a veranda. What he saw in the foreground was a whitish brown\\nplain, apparently a desert, but in reality a plateau, or \"park,\" as the\\nlocal name has it, a tableland usually carpeted not only with grama and\\nbuffalo grasses curing on the stem, but also with flowers in prodigal\\nabundance and of bewildering varieties. True, in the picture framed by\\nthe open door neither grass-stems nor flowers were visible, unless to\\nthe imaginative eye. There was far too much coming and going of men and\\nanimals across the strip of common which served the purposes of a main\\nstreet in Bison to permit the presence of active vegetation save during\\nthe miraculous fortnight after the spring rains, when, by local repute,\\ngreen whiskers will grow on a bronze dog. Scattered about the immediate\\nvicinity were the ramshackle houses of men employed in the neighboring\\ngold and silver reduction works. The makeshift for a roadway which\\npierced this irregular settlement led straight to MacGonigal\\'s, and\\nended there. As every man, woman, and child in the place came to the\\nstore at some time of the day or night, and invariably applied Euclid\\'s\\ndefinition of the nearest way between two given points, the flora of\\nColorado was quickly stamped out of recognition in that particular\\nlocality, except during the irrepressible period when, as already\\nmentioned, the fierce rains of April pounded the sleeping earth and even\\nbronze dogs into a frenzied activity. Further, during that year, now\\nnearly quarter of a century old, there had been no rain in April or May,\\nand precious little in March. As the ranchers put it, in the figurative\\nlanguage of their calling, \"the hull blame state was burnt to a cinder.\"\\n\\nThe middle distance was lost altogether; for the park sloped, after the\\nmanner of plateaus, to a deep valley through which trickled a railroad\\nand the remains of a river. Some twenty miles away a belt of woodland\\nshowed where Denver was justifying its name by growing into a city, and\\nforty miles beyond Denver rose the blue ring of the Rocky Mountains.\\nThese details, be it understood, are given with the meticulous accuracy\\ninsisted on by map-makers. In a country where, every year, the\\npercentage of \"perfectly clear\" days rises well above the total of all\\nother sorts of days, and where a popular and never-failing joke played\\non the newcomer is to persuade him into taking an afternoon stroll from\\nDenver to Mount Evans, a ramble of over sixty miles as the crow flies,\\nthe mind refuses to be governed by theodolites and measuring rods.\\nIndeed, the deceptive clarity of the air leads to exaggeration at the\\nother end of the scale, because no true son or daughter of Colorado will\\nwalk a hundred yards if there is a horse or car available for the\\njourney. Obviously, walking is a vain thing when the horizon and the\\nnext block look equidistant.\\n\\nIt may, however, be taken for granted that none of these considerations\\naccounted for MacGonigal\\'s fixed stare at the sunlit expanse. In fact,\\nit is probable that his bulging eyes took in no special feature of the\\nlandscape; for they held an introspective look, and he stopped polishing\\nthe counter as abruptly as he had begun that much-needed operation when\\nPower entered the store. He indulged in soliloquy, too, as the habit is\\nof some men in perplexity. Shifting the cigar he was smoking from the\\nleft corner of his wide mouth to the right one by a dexterous twisting\\nof lips, with tongue and teeth assisting, he said aloud:\\n\\n\"Well, ef I ain\\'t dog-goned!\"\\n\\nSo, whatever it was, the matter was serious. It was a convention at\\nBison that all conversation should be suspended among the frequenters of\\nMacGonigal\\'s when the storekeeper remarked that he was dog-goned. Ears\\nalready alert were tuned at once to intensity. When Mac was dog-goned,\\nevents of vital importance to the community had either happened or were\\nabout to happen. Why, those words, uttered by him, common as they were\\nin the mouths of others, had been known to stop One-thumb Jake from\\nopening a jack-pot on a pat straight! Of course, the pot was opened all\\nright after the social avanlanche heralded by the storekeeper\\'s\\nepoch-making ejaculation had rolled past, or Jake\\'s remaining thumb\\nmight have been shot off during the subsequent row.\\n\\nApparently, MacGonigal was thinking hard, listening, too; for he seemed\\nto be following Power\\'s movements, and nodded his head in recognition of\\nthe rattle of a chain as the horse was tied to a feeding trough, the\\nclatter of a zinc bucket when Power drew water from a tank, and the\\nstamping of hoofs while Power was persuading the lame mustang to let him\\nbathe and bandage the injured tendons. Then the animal was given a\\ndrink--he would be fed later--and the ring of spurred boots on the\\nsun-baked ground announced that Derry was returning to the store.\\n\\nPower\\'s nickname, in a land where a man\\'s baptismal certificate is\\ngenerally ignored, was easily accounted for by his second name, Darien,\\nconferred by a proud mother in memory of a journey across the Isthmus\\nwhen, as a girl, she was taken from New York to San Francisco by the\\noldtime sea route. The other day, when he stood for a minute or so in\\nthe foyer of the Savoy Hotel in London, waiting while his automobile was\\nsummoned from the courtyard, he seemed to have lost little of the erect,\\nsinewy figure and lithe carriage which were his most striking physical\\ncharacteristics twenty-five years ago; but the smooth, dark-brown hair\\nhad become gray, and was slightly frizzled about the temples, and the\\nclean-cut oval of his face bore records of other tempests than those\\nnoted by the Weather Bureau. In walking, too, he moved with a decided\\nlimp. At fifty, John Darien Power looked the last man breathing whom a\\nstorekeeper in a disheveled mining village would hail as \"Derry\"; yet it\\nmay be safely assumed that his somewhat hard and care-lined lips would\\nhave softened into a pleasant smile had someone greeted him in the\\nfamiliar Colorado way. And, when that happened, the friend of bygone\\nyears would be sure that no mistake had been made as to his identity;\\nfor, in those early days, Power always won approval when he smiled. His\\nhabitual expression was one of concentrated purpose, and his features\\nwere cast in a mold that suggested repose and strength. Indeed, their\\nclassic regularity of outline almost bespoke a harsh nature were it not\\nfor the lurking humor in his large brown eyes, which were shaded by\\nlashes so long, and black, and curved that most women who met him\\nenvied him their possession. Children and dogs adopted him as a friend\\npromptly and without reservation; but strangers of adult age were apt to\\nregard him as a rather morose and aloof-mannered person, distinctly\\nfrigid and self-possessed, until some chance turn in the talk brought\\nlaughter to eyes and lips. Then a carefully veiled kindliness of heart\\nseemed to bubble to the surface and irradiate his face. All the severity\\nof firm mouth and determined chin disappeared as though by magic; and\\none understood the force of the simile used by a western schoolma\\'am,\\nwho contributed verse to the _Rocky Mountain News_, when she said that\\nDerry\\'s smile reminded her of a sudden burst of sunshine which had\\nconverted into a sparkling mirror the somber gloom of a lake sunk in the\\ndepths of some secluded valley. Even in Colorado, people of the poetic\\ntemperament write in that strain.\\n\\nNow, perhaps, you have some notion of the sort of young man it was who\\ncame back to the dog-goned MacGonigal on that June day in the\\nhalf-forgotten \\'80\\'s. Add to the foregoing description certain intimate\\nlabels--that he was a mining engineer, that he had been educated in the\\nbest schools of the Far West, that he was slender, and well knit, and\\nslightly above the middle height, and that he moved with the gait of a\\nhorseman and an athlete--and the portrait is fairly complete.\\n\\nThe storekeeper was Power\\'s physical antithesis. He was short and fat,\\nand never either walked or rode; but his North of Ireland ancestors had\\nbequeathed him a shrewd brain and a Scottish slowness of speech that\\ngave him time to review his thoughts before they were uttered. No sooner\\ndid he hear his visitor\\'s approaching footsteps than he began again to\\npolish the pine boards which barricaded him from the small world of\\nBison.\\n\\nSuch misplaced industry won a smile from the younger man.\\n\\n\"Gee whizz, Mac, it makes me hot to see you work!\" he cried. \"Anyhow, if\\nyou\\'ve been whirling that duster ever since I blew in you must be tired,\\nso you can quit now, and fix me a bimetallic.\"\\n\\nWith a curious alacrity, the stout MacGonigal threw the duster aside,\\nand reached for a bottle of whisky, an egg, a siphon of soda, and some\\npowdered sugar. Colorado is full of local color, even to the naming of\\nits drinks. In a bimetallic the whole egg is used, and variants of the\\nconcoction are a gold fizz and a silver fizz, wherein the yoke and the\\nwhite figure respectively.\\n\\n\"Whar you been, Derry?\" inquired the storekeeper, whose massive energy\\nwas now concentrated on the proper whisking of the egg.\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t you heard? Marten sent me to erect the pump on a placer mine he\\nbought near Sacramento. It\\'s a mighty good proposition, too, and I\\'ve\\ndone pretty well to get through in four months.\"\\n\\n\"Guess I was told about the mine; but I plumb forgot. Marten was here a\\nbit sence, an\\' he said nothin\\'.\" Power laughed cheerfully. \"He\\'ll be\\nsurprised to see me, and that\\'s a fact. He counted on the job using up\\nthe best part of the summer, right into the fall; but I made those\\nChicago mechanics open up the throttle, and here I am, having left\\neverything in full swing.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you write?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, to Denver. I don\\'t mind telling you, Mac, that I would have been\\nbetter pleased if the boss was there now. I came slick through, meaning\\nto make Denver tomorrow. Where is he--at the mill?\"\\n\\n\"He was thar this mornin\\'.\"\\n\\nPower was frankly puzzled by MacGonigal\\'s excess of reticence. He knew\\nthe man so well that he wondered what sinister revelation lay behind\\nthis twice-repeated refusal to give a direct reply to his questions. By\\nthis time the appetizing drink was ready, and he swallowed it with the\\ngusto of one who had found the sun hot and the trail dusty, though he\\nhad ridden only three miles from the railroad station in the valley,\\nwhere he was supplied with a lame horse by the blunder of a <DW64>\\nattendant at the hotel.\\n\\nIt was his way to solve a difficulty by taking the shortest possible\\ncut; but, being quite in the dark as to the cause of his friend\\'s\\nperceptible shirking of some unknown trouble, he decided to adopt what\\nlogicians term a process of exhaustion.\\n\\n\"All well at Dolores?\" he asked, looking straight into the storekeeper\\'s\\nprominent eyes.\\n\\n\"Bully!\" came the unblinking answer.\\n\\nAh! The worry, whatsoever it might be, evidently did not concern John\\nDarien Power in any overwhelming degree.\\n\\n\"Then what have you got on your chest, Mac?\" he said, while voice and\\nmanner softened from an unmistakably stiffening.\\n\\nMacGonigal seemed to regard this personal inquiry anent his well-being\\nas affording a safe means of escape from a dilemma. \"I\\'m scairt about\\nyou, Derry,\" he said at once, and there was no doubting the sincerity of\\nthe words.\\n\\n\"About me?\"\\n\\n\"Yep. Guess you\\'d better hike back to Sacramento.\"\\n\\n\"But why?\"\\n\\n\"Marten \\'ud like it.\"\\n\\n\"Man, I\\'ve written to tell him I was on the way to Denver!\"\\n\\n\"Then git a move on, an\\' go thar.\"\\n\\nPower smiled, though not with his wonted geniality, for he was minded to\\nbe sarcastic. \"Sorry if I should offend the boss by turning up in\\nBison,\" he drawled; \"but if I can\\'t hold this job down I\\'ll monkey\\naround till I find another. If you should happen to see Marten this\\nafternoon, tell him I\\'m at the ranch, and will show up in Main Street\\ntomorrow P.M.\"\\n\\nHe was actually turning on his heel when MacGonigal cried:\\n\\n\"Say, Derry, air you heeled?\"\\n\\nPower swung round again, astonishment writ large on his face. \"Why, no,\"\\nhe said. \"I\\'m not likely to be carrying a gold brick to Dolores. Who\\'s\\ngoing to hold me up?\"\\n\\n\"Bar jokin\\', I wish you\\'d vamoose. Dang me, come back tomorrer, ef you\\nmust!\"\\n\\nThere! MacGonigal had said it! In a land where swearing is a science\\nthis Scoto-Hibernico-American had earned an enviable repute for the\\nmildness of his expletives, and his \"dang me!\" was as noteworthy in\\nBison as its European equivalent in the mouth of a British archbishop.\\nPower was immensely surprised by his bulky friend\\'s emphatic\\nearnestness, and cudgeled his brains to suggest a reasonable\\nexplanation. Suddenly it occurred to him a second time that Bison was\\nsingularly empty of inhabitants that day. MacGonigal\\'s query with regard\\nto a weapon was also significant, and he remembered that when he left\\nthe district there was pending a grave dispute between ranchers and\\nsquatters as to the inclosing of certain grazing lands on the way to the\\nEast and its markets.\\n\\n\"Are the boys wire-cutting today?\" he asked, in the accents of real\\nconcern; for any such expedition would probably bring about a struggle\\nwhich might not end till one or both of the opposing parties ran short\\nof ammunition.\\n\\n\"Nit,\" growled the other. \"Why argy? You jest take my say-so, Derry, an\\'\\nskate.\"\\n\\n\"Is the boss mixed up in this?\"\\n\\n\"Yep.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he can take care of himself as well as anyone I know. So long,\\nMac. See you later.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, come off, Derry. You\\'ve got to have it; but don\\'t say I didn\\'t try\\nto help. The crowd are up at Dolores. Marten\\'s gittin\\' married, an\\'\\nthat\\'s all there is to it. Now I guess you\\'ll feel mad with me for not\\ntellin\\' you sooner.\"\\n\\nPower\\'s face blanched under its healthy tan of sun and air; but his\\nvoice was markedly clear and controlled when he spoke, which, however,\\nhe did not do until some seconds after MacGonigal had made what was,\\nfor him, quite an oration.\\n\\n\"Why should Marten go to Dolores to get married?\" he said at last.\\n\\nThe storekeeper humped his heavy shoulders, and conjured the cigar\\nacross his mouth again. He did not flinch under the sudden fire which\\nblazed in Power\\'s eyes; nevertheless, he remained silent.\\n\\n\"Mac,\" went on the younger man, still uttering each word deliberately,\\n\"do you mean that Marten is marrying Nancy Willard?\"\\n\\n\"Yep.\"\\n\\n\"And you\\'ve kept me here all this time! God in Heaven, Man, find me a\\nhorse!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s too late, Derry. They was wed three hours sence.\"\\n\\n\"Too late for what? Get me a horse!\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s not a nag left in Bison. An\\' it\\'ll do you no sort of good ter\\nshoot Marten.\"\\n\\n\"Mac, you\\'re no fool. He sent me to Sacramento to have me out of the\\nway, and you\\'ve seen through it right along.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe. But old man Willard was dead broke. This dry spell put him slick\\nunder the harrow. Nancy married Marten ter save her father.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a lie! They made her believe it, perhaps; but Willard could have\\nwon through as others have done. That scheming devil Marten got me\\nside-tracked on purpose. He planned it, just as David put Uriah in the\\nforefront of the battle. But, by God, he\\'s not a king, any more than I\\'m\\na Hittite! Nancy Willard is not for him, nor ever will be. Give me--but\\nI know you won\\'t, and it doesn\\'t matter, anyway, because I\\'d rather\\ntear him with my hands.\"\\n\\nAn overpowering sense of wrong and outrage had Power in its grip now,\\nand his naturally sallow skin had assumed an ivory whiteness that was\\ndreadful to see. So rigid was his self-control that he gave no other\\nsign of the passion that was convulsing him. Turning toward the door, he\\nthrust his right hand to the side of the leather belt he wore; but\\nwithdrew it instantly, for he was a law-abiding citizen, and had obeyed\\nin letter and spirit the recently enacted ordinance against the carrying\\nof weapons. He would have gone without another word had not MacGonigal\\nslipped from behind the counter with the deft and catlike ease of\\nmovement which some corpulent folk of both sexes seem to possess.\\nRunning lightly and stealthily on his toes, he caught Power\\'s arm before\\nthe latter was clear of the veranda which shaded the front of the store.\\n\\n\"Whar \\'r you goin\\', Derry?\" he asked, with a note of keen solicitude in\\nhis gruff voice that came oddly in a man accustomed to the social\\namenities of a mining camp.\\n\\n\"Leave me alone, Mac. I must be alone!\" Then Power bent a flaming glance\\non him. \"You\\'ve told me the truth?\" he added in a hoarse whisper.\\n\\n\"Sure thing. You must ha passed the minister between here an\\' the\\ndepot.\"\\n\\n\"He had been there--to marry them?\"\\n\\n\"Yep.\"\\n\\n\"And everyone is up at the ranch, drinking the health of Marten and his\\nbride?\"\\n\\n\"Guess that\\'s so.\"\\n\\nPower tried to shake off the detaining hand. \"It\\'s a pity that I should\\nbe an uninvited guest, but it can\\'t be helped,\" he said savagely. \"You\\nsee, I was carrying out the millionaire\\'s orders--earning him more\\nmillions--and I ought to have taken longer over the job. And, Nancy too!\\nWhat lie did they tell her about me? I hadn\\'t asked her to be my wife,\\nbecause it wouldn\\'t have been fair; yet--but she knew! She knew! Let me\\ngo, Mac!\"\\n\\nMacGonigal clutched him more tightly. \"Ah, say, Derry,\" he cried\\nthickly, \"hev\\' you forgot you\\'ve left me yer mother\\'s address in San\\nFrancisco? In case of accidents, you said. Well, am I ter write an\\' tell\\nher you killed a man on his weddin\\' day, and was hanged for it?\"\\n\\n\"For the Lord\\'s sake, don\\'t hold me, Mac!\"\\n\\nThe storekeeper, with a wisdom born of much experience, took his hand\\noff Power\\'s arm at once, but contrived to edge forward until he was\\nalmost facing his distraught friend.\\n\\n\"Now, look-a here!\" he said slowly. \"This air a mighty bad business; but\\nyou cahn\\'t mend it, an\\' ef you go cavortin\\' round in a red-eyed temper\\nyou\\'ll sure make it wuss. You\\'ve lost the gal--never mind how--an\\'\\ngittin\\' a strangle hold on Marten won\\'t bring her back. Yer mother\\'s a\\nheap more to you ner that gal--now.\"\\n\\nOne wonders what hidden treasury of insight into the deeps of human\\nnature MacGonigal was drawing on by thus bringing before the mind\\'s eye\\nof an unhappy son the mother he loved. But there was no gainsaying the\\nsoundness and efficiency of his judgment. Only half comprehending his\\nfriendly counselor\\'s purpose, Power quivered like a high-spirited horse\\nunder the prick of a spur. He put his hands to his face, as if the\\ngesture would close out forever the horrific vision which the memory of\\nthat gray-haired woman in San Francisco was beginning to dispel. For the\\nfirst time in his young life he had felt the lust of slaying, and the\\ninstinct of the jungle thrilled through every nerve, till his nails\\nclenched and his teeth bit in a spasm of sheer delirium.\\n\\nMacGonigal, despite his present load of flesh, must have passed through\\nthe fiery furnace himself in other days; for he recognized the varying\\nphases of the obsession against which Power was fighting.\\n\\nHence, he knew when to remain silent, and, again, he knew when to\\nexorcise the demon, once and for all, by the spoken word. It was so\\nstill there on that sun-scorched plateau that the mellow whistle of an\\nengine came full-throated from the distant railroad. The lame horse,\\nbothered by the tight bandage which Power had contrived out of a girth,\\npawed uneasily in his stall. From the reduction works, half a mile away,\\ncame the grinding clatter of a mill chewing ore in its steel jaws. These\\nfamiliar sounds served only to emphasize the brooding solitude of the\\nplace. Some imp of mischief seemed to whisper that every man who could\\nbe spared from his work, and every woman and child able to walk, was\\naway making merry at the wedding of Hugh Marten and Nancy Willard.\\n\\nThe storekeeper must have heard that malicious prompting, and he\\ncombated it most valiantly.\\n\\n\"Guess you\\'d better come inside, Derry,\" he said, with quiet sympathy.\\n\"You\\'re feelin\\' mighty bad, an\\' I allow you hain\\'t touched a squar\\' meal\\nsence the Lord knows when.\"\\n\\nHe said the right thing by intuition. The mere fantasy of the implied\\nbelief that a quantity of cold meat and pickles, washed down by a pint\\nof Milwaukee lager, would serve as an emollient for raw emotion,\\nrestored Power to his right mind. He placed a hand on MacGonigal\\'s\\nshoulder, and the brown eyes which met his friend\\'s no longer glowered\\nwith frenzy.\\n\\n\"I\\'m all right now,\" he said, in a dull, even voice; for this youngster\\nof twenty-five owned an extra share of that faculty of self-restraint\\nwhich is the birthright of every man and woman born and bred on the\\nback-bone of North America. \"I took it pretty hard at first, Mac; but\\nI\\'m not one to cry over spilt milk. You know that, eh? No, I can\\'t eat\\nor drink yet awhile. I took a lunch below here at the depot. Tell me\\nthis, will you? They--they\\'ll be leaving by train?\"\\n\\n\"Yep. Special saloon kyar on the four-ten east. I reckon you saw it on a\\nsidin\\', but never suspicioned why it was thar.\"\\n\\n\"East? New York and Europe, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Guess that\\'s about the line.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll show up here about half-past four. Till then I\\'ll fool round\\nby myself. Don\\'t worry, Mac. I mean that, and no more.\"\\n\\nHe walked a few yards; but was arrested by a cry:\\n\\n\"Not that-a way, Derry! Any other old trail but that!\"\\n\\nThen Power laughed; but his laughter was the wail of a soul in pain, for\\nhe had gone in the direction of the Dolores ranch. He waved a hand, and\\nthe gesture was one of much grace and distinction, because Power\\ninsensibly carried himself as a born leader of men.\\n\\n\"Just quit worrying, I tell you,\" he said calmly. \"I understand. The\\nboys will escort them to that millionaire saloon. They\\'ll be a lively\\ncrowd, of course; but they won\\'t see me, never fear.\"\\n\\nThen he strode off, his spurs jingling in rhythm with each long,\\nathletic pace. He headed straight for a narrow cleft in the hill at the\\nback of the store, a cleft locally known as the Gulch, and beyond it, on\\nanother plateau sloping to the southeast, lay the Willard homestead.\\n\\nMacGonigal watched the tall figure until it vanished in the upward\\ncurving of the path. Then he rolled the cigar between his heavy lips\\nagain until it was securely lodged in the opposite corner of his mouth;\\nbut the maneuver was wasted,--the cigar was out,--and such a thing had\\nnot happened in twenty years! To mark an unprecedented incident, he\\nthrew away an unconsumed half.\\n\\n\"He\\'s crazy ter have a last peep at Nancy,\" he communed. \"An\\' they\\'d\\nhave made a bully fine pair, too, ef it hadn\\'t been fer that skunk\\nMarten. Poor Derry! Mighty good job I stopped home, or he\\'d ha gone\\nplumb to hell.\"\\n\\nOf course, the storekeeper was talking to himself; so he may not have\\nsaid it, really. But he thought it, and, theologically, that is as bad.\\nMoreover, he might have electrified Bison by his language that night\\nwere he gifted with second sight; for he had seen the last of the proud,\\nself-contained yet light-hearted and generous-souled cavalier whom he\\nhad known and liked as \"Derry\" Power. They were fated to meet again many\\ntimes, under conditions as varying as was ever recorded in a romance of\\nreal life; but MacGonigal had to find a place in his heart for a new\\nman, because \"Derry\" Power was dead--had died there in the open doorway\\nof the store--and a stranger named John Darien Power reigned in his\\nstead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nTHE TERMS\\n\\n\\nThe Gulch was naked but unashamed, and lay in a drowsy stupor. An\\neasterly breeze, bringing coolness elsewhere, here gathered radiated\\nheat from gaunt walls on which the sun had poured all day, and\\ndesiccating gusts beat on Power\\'s face like superheated air gushing from\\na furnace. Not that the place was an inferno--far from it. On a June day\\njust a year ago two young people had ridden up the rough trail on their\\nway to the Dolores ranch, and the girl had called the man\\'s attention to\\nthe exquisite coloring of the rocks and the profusion of flowers which\\ndecked every niche and crevice. It may be that they looked then through\\neyes which would have tinted with rose the dreariest of scenes; but even\\ntoday, in another couple of hours, when the sun was sinking over the\\nmountain range to the west, the Gulch would assuredly don a marvelous\\nlivery of orange, and red, and violet. Each stray clump of stunted\\nherbage which had survived the drought would make a brave show, and\\nrock-mosses which should be moist and green would not spoil the picture\\nbecause they were withered and brown or black.\\n\\nBut Power, despite a full share of the artist\\'s temperament, was blind\\nto the fierce blending of color which the cliffs offered in the blaze of\\nsunlight. His eyes were peering into his own soul, and he saw naught\\nthere but dun despair and icy self-condemnation. For he blamed himself\\nfor wrecking two lives. If Nancy Willard could possibly find happiness\\nas Hugh Marten\\'s wife, he might indeed have cursed the folly of\\nhesitation that lost her; but there would be the salving consciousness\\nthat she, at least, would drink of the nectar which wealth can buy in\\nsuch Homeric drafts. But he was denied the bitter-sweet recompense of\\naltruism. He knew Nancy, and he knew Marten, and he was sure that the\\nfairest wild flower which the Dolores ranch had ever seen would wilt and\\npine in the exotic atmosphere into which her millionaire husband would\\nplunge her.\\n\\nHugh Marten was a man of cold and crafty nature. Success, and a close\\nstudy of its essentials, had taught him to be studiously polite, bland,\\neven benignant, when lavish display of these qualities suited his\\npurposes. But he could spring with the calculating ferocity of a panther\\nif thereby the object in view might be attained more swiftly and with\\nequal certainty. His upward progress among the mining communities of\\nColorado, New Mexico, and, more recently, California had been\\nmeteoric--once it began. None suspected the means until they saw the\\nend; then angry and disappointed rivals would compare notes, recognizing\\ntoo late how he had encouraged this group to fight that, only to gorge\\nboth when his financial digestion was ready for the meal. He had the\\nfaculty, common to most of his type, of surrounding himself with able\\nlieutenants. Thus, John Darien Power came to him with no stronger\\nbacking than a college degree in metallurgy and a certificate of\\nproficiency as a mining engineer, credentials which an army of young\\nAmericans can produce; but he discerned in this one young man the master\\nsense of the miner\\'s craft, and promoted him rapidly.\\n\\nHe paid well, too, gave excellent bonuses over and above a high\\nsalary--was, in fact, a pioneer among those merchant princes who\\ndiscovered that a helper is worth what he earns, not what he costs--and\\nPower was actually entitled, through his handling of the Sacramento\\nplacer mine, to a sum large enough to warrant marriage with the woman he\\nloved. Not for one instant had the assistant dreamed that his chief was\\ncasting a covetous eye on Nancy Willard. She was a girl of twenty, he a\\nman looking ten years older than the thirty-eight years he claimed.\\nApparently, she was wholly unsuited to become the wife of a financial\\nmagnate. She knew nothing of the outer maze of society and politics;\\nwhile it was whispered that Marten would soon run for state governor, to\\nbe followed by a senatorship, and, possibly, by an embassy. To help such\\nambitious emprise he needed a skilled partner, a woman of the world, a\\nmate born and reared in the purple, and none imagined, Power least of\\nany, that the vulture would swoop on the pretty little song-bird which\\nhad emerged from the broken-down cage of the Dolores ranch. For the\\nplace had been well named. Misfortune had dogged its owner\\'s footsteps\\never since the death of his wife ten years earlier, and Francis Willard\\nwas buffeted by Fate with a kind of persistent malevolence. Neighboring\\nfarms had been rich in metals; his was bare. When other ranchers won\\nwealth by raising stock, he hardly held his own against disease,\\ndishonest agents, and unfortunate choice of markets. This present arid\\nseason had even taken from him three-fourths of his store cattle.\\n\\nPower did not know yet how the marriage had been brought to an issue so\\nspeedily. In time, no doubt, he would fit together the pieces of the\\npuzzle; but that day his wearied brain refused to act. He might hazard a\\nvague guess that he had been misrepresented, that his absence in\\nCalifornia was construed falsely, that the letters he wrote had never\\nreached the girl\\'s hands; but he was conscious now only of a numb\\nfeeling of gratitude that he had been saved from killing his usurper,\\nand of an overmastering desire to look once more on Nancy\\'s face before\\nshe passed out of his life forever.\\n\\nHe climbed the Gulch to the divide. From that point he could see the\\nlong, low buildings of the ranch, lying forlornly in the midst of empty\\nstockyards and scorched grazing land; though the Dolores homestead\\nitself looked neither forlorn nor grief-stricken. A hundred horses, or\\nmore, were tethered in the branding yard near the house. Two huge tents\\nhad been brought from Denver; the smoke of a field oven showed that some\\nprofessional caterer was busy; and a great company of men, women, and\\nchildren was gathered at that very moment near the porch, close to which\\na traveling carriage was drawn up. A spluttering _feu de joie_, sounding\\nin the still air like the sharp cracking of a whip, announced that the\\ndeparture of bride and bridegroom was imminent; but the pair of horses\\nattached to the carriage reared and bucked owing to the shouting, and\\nPower had a momentary glimpse of a trim, neat figure, attired in\\nbiscuit- cloth, and wearing a hat gay with red poppies, standing\\nin the veranda. Close at hand was a tall man dressed in gray tweed.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Hugh Marten were about to start on their honeymoon trip to\\nNew York and Europe!\\n\\nFor an instant Power\\'s eyes were blinded with tears; but he brushed away\\nthe weakness with a savage gesture, and examined the stark rocks on each\\nside in search of a nook whence he might see without being seen. It was\\nthe careless glance of a man maddened with well-nigh intolerable loss;\\nyet, had he known how much depended on his choice of a refuge, even in\\nthe very crux of his grief and torment he would have given more heed to\\nit. As it was, he retreated a few paces, until hidden from any chance\\neye which might rove that way from the ranch, chose a break in the cliff\\nwhere an expert cragsman could mount forty feet without difficulty, and\\nfinally threw himself at full length on a ledge which sloped inward, and\\nwas overhung by a mass of red granite, all cracked and blistered by\\ncenturies of elemental war. Some stunted tufts of alfalfa grass were\\ngrowing on the outer lip of the ledge. By taking off his sombrero, and\\npeeping between the dried stems, he could overlook the cavalcade as it\\npassed without anyone being the wiser.\\n\\nThe surface of the rock was so hot as to be almost unbearable; but he\\nwas completely oblivious of any sense of personal discomfort. That side\\nof the Gulch was in shadow now, and concealment was all he cared for. He\\nwas sufficiently remote from the narrow track to which the horses would\\nnecessarily be confined that he ran no risk of yielding to some\\nberserker fit of rage if he encountered Marten\\'s surprised scrutiny,\\nwhen, perchance, he might have flung an oath at the man who had\\ndespoiled him, and thereby caused distress to the woman he loved. To\\navoid that calamity, he would have endured worse evils than the\\nblistering rock.\\n\\nHe remembered afterward that while he waited, crouched there like some\\ncreature of the wild, his mind was nearly a blank. He was conscious only\\nof a dull torpor of wrath and suffering. He had neither plan nor hope\\nfor the future. His profession, which he loved, had suddenly grown\\nirksome. In curiously detached mood, he saw the long procession of days\\nin the mines, in the mart, in the laboratory. And the nights--ah, dear\\nHeaven, the nights! What horror of dreariness would come to him then! He\\nseemed to hear an inner voice bidding him abandon it all, and hide in\\nsome remote corner of the world where none knew him, and where every\\nfamiliar sight and sound would not remind him of Nancy Willard. Nancy\\nWillard--she was Nancy Marten now! He awoke to a dim perception of his\\nsurroundings by hearing his teeth grating. And even that trivial thing\\nbrought an exquisite pain of memory; for Nancy, reading a book one day,\\ncame across a passage in which some disappointed rascal had \"ground his\\nteeth in baffled rage,\" and he had joined in her shout of glee at the\\nnotion that anyone should express emotion so crudely. So, then, a man\\nmight really vent his agony in that way! Truly, one lived and learned,\\nand this was certainly an afternoon during which he had acquired an\\nintensive knowledge of life and its vicissitudes.\\n\\nBut now the elfin screeching of excited cowboys, and a continuous\\nfusillade of revolvers fired in the air as their owners raced alongside\\nthe lumbering coach, announced that the wedded pair had begun their long\\njourney. The racket of yells and shooting, heightened by weird sounds\\nextracted from tin trumpets, bugles, and horns, drew rapidly nearer,\\nand, at any other time, Power would have been amused and interested by\\nthe sudden eruption of life in the canyon brought about by this unwonted\\nintrusion on its peace. A horse or so, or a drove of steers, these were\\nnormal features of existence, and no respectable denizen of the Gulch\\nwould allow such trifles to trouble his or her alert wits for a moment.\\nBut this tornado of pistol-shots and bellowing was a very different\\nmatter, and coyotes, jack-rabbits, a magnificent mountain sheep, a\\ncouple of great lizards--in fact, all manner of furred and scaly\\ncreatures--deserted lairs where they might have remained in perfect\\nsecurity, scampered frantically to other retreats, and doubtless cowered\\nthere till dusk.\\n\\nA coyote raced up the cleft at the top of which Power was hidden; but,\\nere ever he had seen his enemy, man, he was aware of the hidden danger,\\nand fled to an untainted sanctuary elsewhere. He had hardly vanished\\nbefore the leading horsemen galloped into sight, and soon a motley but\\nhighly picturesque regiment of Westerners filled the trail to its utmost\\ncapacity. Both men and horses were at home in this rugged land, and\\nraced over its inequalities at a pace which would have brought down many\\na rider who thinks he is a devil of a fellow when a mounted policeman\\ngallops after him in the park and cautions him sharply to moderate his\\nown and his steed\\'s exuberance. Even in the joyous abandonment of this\\ntypical western crowd there was a species of order; for they took care\\nnot to incommode the coach, a cumbersome vehicle, but the only\\npracticable conveyance of its kind on four wheels which could be trusted\\nto traverse that rock-strewn path. Its heavy body was slung on stout\\nleather bands, and the wheels were low, set well apart, and moving on\\naxles calculated to withstand every sort of jolt and strain. The driver\\nwas performing some excellent balancing feats on his perch while he\\negged on a willing team or exchanged yells with some other choice spirit\\nwho tore ahead when the road permitted. Among the throng were not a few\\nwomen and girls from Bison. They rode astride like their men folk, and\\ntheir shrill voices mingled cheerfully in the din.\\n\\nPower was deaf and blind to the pandemonium and its sprites: he had eyes\\nonly for the two people seated in the coach. The ancient equipage owned\\nlow seats and lofty windows, having been built during a period when\\nladies\\' headgear soared well above normal standards; so its occupants\\nwere in full view, even at the elevation from which the unseen observer\\nlooked down.\\n\\nMarten, a powerfully built man, of commanding height and good physique,\\nclean-shaven, though the habit was far from general in the West at that\\ndate, was evidently exerting himself to soothe and interest his pallid\\ncompanion. His swarthy face was flushed, and its constant smile was\\neffortless; for he had schooled himself to adapt the mood to the hour.\\nAs the personnel of the cavalcade changed with each headlong gallop or\\nsudden halt, he nodded affably to the men, or bowed with some\\ndistinction to the women; for Marten knew, or pretended that he knew,\\nevery inhabitant of Bison.\\n\\nHis wife knew them too, without any pretense; but she kept her eyes\\nstudiously lowered, and, if she spoke, used monosyllables, and those\\nscarcely audible, for Marten had obviously to ask twice what she had\\nsaid even during the fleeting seconds when the pair were visible to\\nPower. Her features were composed almost to apathy; but the watcher from\\nthe cliff, who could read the slightest change of expression in a face\\nas mobile to the passing mood as a mountain tarn to the breeze, felt\\nthat she was fulfilling a compact and holding her emotions in tense\\nsubjection.\\n\\nHe hoped, he prayed, with frenzied craving of the most high gods, that\\nshe might be moved to lift her eyes to his aery; but the petition was\\ndenied, and the last memory vouchsafed of her was the sight of her\\ngloved hands clasped on her lap and holding a few sprigs of white\\nheather. Now, it was a refined malignity of Fate which revealed that\\nfact just then, because heather does not grow in Colorado, and the girl\\nhad culled her simple little bouquet from a plant which Power had given\\nher. Once, in Denver, he had rendered some slight service to an\\nexpatriated Scot, and, when a sister from Perth joined her brother,\\nbringing with her a pot of Highland soil in which bloomed the shrub dear\\nto every Scottish heart, Power was offered a cutting \"for luck.\" Great\\nwas Nancy Willard\\'s delight at the gift; for, like the majority of her\\nsex, she yielded to pleasant superstition, and the fame of white heather\\nas a mascot has spread far beyond the bounds of Great Britain.\\n\\nPower might well have cried aloud in his pain when he discovered that\\nhis lost love had thought of him at the moment she was leaving her old\\nhome. Perhaps he did utter some tortured plaint: he never knew, because\\nof what happened the instant after Nancy and her spray of heather were\\nreft from his straining vision.\\n\\nOne-thumb Jake, who had loitered at the ranch for a farewell drink, rode\\nup at a terrific pace, pulled his bronco on to its haunches alongside\\nthe coach, and by way of salute, fired three shots from a revolver as\\nquickly as finger could press trigger.\\n\\nThe first bullet sang through the air not more than an inch above\\nPower\\'s forehead. He recalled afterward a slight stirring of his hair\\ncaused by the passing of the missile, which spat viciously against the\\nwall of rock some ten feet above the ledge. The next two bullets struck\\nhigher, and their impact evidently disturbed the equipoise of a mass of\\nstone already disintegrated by frost, because more than a ton of debris\\ncrashed down, pinning Power to the ledge and nearly pounding the life\\nout of him. The resultant cloud of dust probably helped to render him\\nunconscious. At any rate, he lay there without word or movement, and, if\\nhe were dead, his bones might have rested many a year in that strange\\ntomb unless the curiosity of some passerby was aroused by a flock of\\nquarreling vultures--a spectacle so common in cattle-land that the\\nwayfarer does not deviate a hand\\'s breadth from his path because of it.\\n\\nNancy heard the thunder of the falling rocks, and looked out. The dust\\npall told her exactly what had occurred, though the jubilant\\ncongratulation of the shooter by the driver would have explained matters\\nin any event.\\n\\n\"Good fer you, Jake!\" he shouted. \"Gosh! when you\\'re fed up on\\ncowpunchin\\' you kin go minin\\' wid a gun!\"\\n\\nShe saw, too, what many others saw: A rattlesnake, rudely dislodged from\\nsome deep crevice, emerged from the heap of rubbish, stopped suddenly,\\nswelled and puffed in anger, rattled its tail-plates, and was obviously\\nprimed for combat. It seemed to change its mind, however, when a fourth\\nbullet from the cowboy\\'s revolver grazed a big brown rhomboid which\\noffered a fair target just below the curved neck. There was another\\nshower of dust and granite chips, and, when this subsided, the reptile\\nhad vanished.\\n\\nNancy sat back in the coach. Amid a chorus of laughter and jeers at what\\nhis critics were pleased to regard as bad marksmanship, Jake spurred his\\nhorse into a gallop again.\\n\\n\"What was it?\" inquired Marten. Being on the other side of the vehicle,\\nhe was unaware of the cause of this slight commotion.\\n\\n\"Nothing, really,\" she said dully.\\n\\n\"Oh, come now, little woman--the crowd would not yelp at Jake for no\\nreason.\"\\n\\n\"Well, his shots brought down some loose stones, and a rattler appeared\\nin the middle of the heap. It showed fight, too; but made off when Jake\\nfired again.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, is that all? There wouldn\\'t be a snake on the ranch if your father\\nhad kept a few pigs.\"\\n\\n\"Poor old dad couldn\\'t keep anything--not even me!\"\\n\\nHer listless tone might have annoyed a weaker man; but Marten only\\nlaughed pleasantly.\\n\\n\"I should be very unhappy if he had insisted on keeping you,\" he said.\\n\"Of course, you hate having to part from him, and from a place where you\\nhave lived during a few careless years; but you will soon learn to love\\nthe big world to which I am taking you. Colorado in June is all very\\nwell; but it can\\'t begin to compare with London in July, the Engadine in\\nAugust, and Paris in September. Don\\'t forget that the proper study of\\nmankind is man--and woman.\"\\n\\nAnd so, the line was dangled skilfully before her eyes, and the spell\\nwhispered gently into her ears, while she, mute and distraught, wondered\\nwhether the dear memories of Colorado would ever weaken and grow dim.\\nThen she thought of Derry Power, and a film came over her blue eyes; but\\nshe bit her under-lip in brave endeavor, and forced a smile at some\\npassing friend.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nPower did not remain unconscious many minutes. The last straggler among\\nthe mounted contingent was clattering through the canyon when the man\\nwho had been near death three times in the same number of seconds awoke\\nto a burden of physical pain which, for the time, effectually banished\\nall other considerations.\\n\\nAt first he hardly realized where he was or what had happened. He was\\nhalf choked with dust, and the effort of his lungs to secure pure air\\nundoubtedly helped to restore his senses. It was humanly impossible to\\ncurb the impulse toward self-preservation, and he tried at once to free\\nhis limbs of an intolerable weight. He was able to move slightly; but\\nthe agony which racked his left leg warned him that the limb was either\\nbroken or badly sprained. His profession had often brought similar\\naccidents within his ken, and indications of a further probable\\nsubsidence among the fallen stones--though the warning was so slight as\\nto be negligible to the ordinary ear--told him that he must be wary, or\\na second avalanche might kill him outright.\\n\\nBy now the air was breathable, and he could see into the deserted Gulch.\\nHe was well aware that no one might be expected to pass that way during\\nthe next hour. Before returning to the feast in preparation at the\\nranch, the escort would await the departure of the train; while those\\nwho had not taken part in the procession would certainly remain there\\nuntil darkness ended the festivities. So he had the choice of two evils.\\nHe could either possess his soul in patience until the mounted\\ncontingent began to straggle back, or risk another rock-fall.\\n\\nNaturally, he understood the cause and extent of the mishap, and his\\npresent mood did not brook the delay entailed by the safer course.\\nRaising head and shoulders by lifting himself on both hands, he\\ncontrived to twist round on his left side, and surveyed the position.\\nIt was bad enough, in all conscience, but might have been worse. By far\\nthe largest piece of granite had been the last to drop, and he saw that\\nit was poised precariously on some smaller lumps. Any attempt to\\nwithdraw either of his legs (the left one was broken, beyond a doubt)\\nwould disturb its balance, and, if it toppled on his body, he would be\\nimprisoned without hope of relief by his own effort. Rising still\\nhigher, though each inch gained cost a twinge of agony that brought\\nsweat from every pore, he achieved a half-sitting, half-lolling posture.\\nThen, applying his miner\\'s aptitude to the dynamics of the problem, he\\npacked the threatening boulder with others until it was wedged into\\npartial security.\\n\\nHe had barely finished this task, which only a splendid vitality enabled\\nhim to carry through, when his eye was caught by something in the new\\nface of the rock which seemed to fascinate him for a second or two. Then\\nhis mouth twisted in a rictus of dreadful mirth, so wrung was he with\\npain, yet so overcome by what he had seen.\\n\\n\"So that is the price!\" he almost shouted, accompanying the words with\\nothers which seldom fell from his lips. \"Those are the terms of\\nsurrender, eh? Well, it is a compact made in hell; but I\\'ll keep it!\"\\n\\nAfter that, his actions savored of a maniac\\'s cunning rather than the\\ndesire of a sane man to save his own life. Slowly, with never a groan,\\nhe extracted both legs from beneath the pile of stones. The spurs were\\nhis chief difficulty. One was held so tightly that he had to tear his\\nfoot out by main force; but luckily it was the right foot, or he could\\nnot have done it. Something had to give way under the strain, and\\nultimately the spur was released by the yielding of a strap at a buckle.\\nThe torture he suffered must have been intense; but he uttered no sound\\nsave an occasional sob of effort, when all the strength of hands and\\nwrists were needed to move one or other of the chunks of granite without\\ndislodging the grim monster he had chained.\\n\\nAt last he was free. He felt the injured limb, which was almost\\nbenumbed, and ascertained beyond doubt that it was fractured below the\\nknee. But he was safe enough, even though the precarious structure of\\nstones collapsed, and any other victim of like circumstances would have\\nbeen content with that tremendous achievement. Not so John Darien Power.\\n\\nThe mere fact that he need now only lie still until assistance reached\\nhim seemed to lash him into a fresh panic of energy. After a hasty\\nglance into the canyon, obviously to find out whether or not anyone was\\napproaching, he began to throw pieces of debris into the fissure left\\nbare by the fall. When he had exhausted the store within reach he\\ncrawled to a new supply, and piled stone upon stone until the rock wall\\nwas covered to a height of more than two feet. Even then he was not\\nsatisfied; but moved a second time, his apparent object, if any, being\\nto give the scene of his accident the semblance of a stone slide.\\n\\nFinally, he did the maddest thing of all, lowering himself down the\\ncleft with a rapidity that was almost inconceivable in a man with a\\nbroken leg. On reaching the level of the trail he slipped and fell.\\nThat drew a queer sort of subdued shriek from his parched throat; but,\\nafter a moment of white agony, he began to crawl in the direction of the\\nranch. He chose that way deliberately, because the <DW72> was downhill,\\nand not so rough as in the upper part of the gorge. With care, for he\\nmeant to avoid another slip, but never halting, he dragged his crippled\\nbody fully a hundred yards from the foot of the ledge. Then he crept\\ninto the shade, at a spot where the side of the Gulch rose sheer for\\ntwenty feet, turned over on his back, and lay quietly.\\n\\nHe had almost reached the end of his tether. His face was drawn, and\\ndisfigured with dirt and perspiration. His eyelids dropped\\ninvoluntarily, as though to shut out a world which had suddenly become\\nsavagely hostile; but his lips moved in a wan grimace, a wry parody of\\nthe generous, warm-hearted smile that people had learned to associate\\nwith Derry Power.\\n\\n\"My poor Nancy!\" he murmured brokenly. \"My dear lost sweetheart! If the\\nFates have bought you from me, I was no party to the deal, and I\\'ll\\nexact the last cent on it--I swear that by your own sprig of white\\nheather! Someone will pay, in blood and tears, or I\\'ll know the reason\\nwhy! Yes, someone will pay! Power versus Marten, with the devil as\\narbitrator! Marten has won the first round; but I\\'ll take it to a higher\\ncourt. I\\'ll choke the life out of him yet--choke--the beast!\"\\n\\nOf course, Power was light-headed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nSHOWING HOW POWER ACQUIRED A LIMP.\\n\\n\\nIf any sentient thought loomed vaguely through the haze of pain and\\nexhaustion which enwrapped Power like a pall, it was that he would\\nprobably lie there a long time before help came; yet he had hardly\\nuttered that half-delirious vow before he was aware of an animal\\nsnuffing cautiously around him, and the knowledge galvanized him into a\\nspecies of activity. He turned on his right side, and raised himself on\\none hand, the fingers of which closed instinctively on a heavy stone as\\nsupplying a weapon of defense.\\n\\nBut his eyes rested only on a dog, a dapper fox-terrier, whose furtive\\ncuriosity changed instantly to alarm, as it retreated some distance, and\\nbarked excitedly. Then Power saw the animal\\'s master, a stranger, or, at\\nany rate, a newcomer, in the district, a man of about his own age, who\\nrode a compactly-built pony with the careless ease of good horsemanship,\\nand was dressed _de rigueur_, except for the broad-brimmed hat demanded\\nby the Colorado sun.\\n\\nEvidently the horseman was not surprised at finding someone lying in the\\nGulch.\\n\\n\"Hullo!\" he cried. \"Had a spill?\"\\n\\nPower tried to speak; but the dust and grit in his throat rendered his\\nwords almost inaudible. Then the other understood that if, as he\\nimagined, copious drafts of champagne had caused some unaccustomed head\\nto reel, the outcome was rather more serious than a mere tumble. He\\nurged the pony rapidly nearer, and dismounted, and a glance at Power\\'s\\nface dispelled his earlier notion.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up?\" he inquired in a sympathetic tone. \"Are you hurt?\"\\n\\nPower\\'s second effort at ordered speech was more successful. \"Yes,\" he\\nsaid. \"My leg is broken.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that\\'s too bad. Which leg?\"\\n\\n\"The left.\"\\n\\n\"Were you thrown?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\nThe stranger noted the soiled condition of the injured man\\'s clothing.\\nHe saw that a spur had been torn off, and among the drying dirt on\\nPower\\'s face and hands were some more ominous streaks; since a man may\\nnot squirm in agony beneath a shower of jagged granite and escape some\\nnasty abrasions of the skin.\\n\\n\"I see,\" he said gently. \"You fell from up there somewhere,\" and he\\nlooked at the cliff, \"tripped over that missing spur, I suppose. Well,\\nwhat\\'s to be done? Were you at the ranch? I didn\\'t happen to come across\\nyou. Shall I take you there?\"\\n\\n\"No, please--to Bison--to MacGonigal\\'s store.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes. But it\\'s an awkward business. You can\\'t possibly hold yourself\\nin the saddle. Can you stand on one leg, even for a few seconds?\"\\n\\n\"I fear not. I\\'m about done.\"\\n\\n\"But if I carry you to the face of the rock there, and prop you against\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ll do that.\"\\n\\nThis friend in need pulled the reins over the pony\\'s head, passed them\\nthrough his arm, lifted Power, not without some difficulty, and brought\\nhim to a spot where the precipice rose like a wall.\\n\\n\"There you are!\" he gasped; for he was of slender proportions, and\\nPower\\'s weight was deceptive, owing to his perfect physical fitness.\\n\"Now I\\'ll mount, and hold you as comfortably as I can; but I don\\'t know\\nhow this fat geegee will behave under a double load, so I must have my\\nhands free at first. Will you grip me tight? It may hurt like sin----\"\\n\\n\"Go right ahead!\" said Power.\\n\\nSure enough, when the pony found what was expected of him, he snorted,\\nraised head and tail, and trotted a few indignant paces.\\n\\nThe rider soon quieted him to a walk; but they were abreast of the scene\\nof Power\\'s accident before he was aware that the man clasping his body\\nhad uttered neither word nor groan, though the prancing of the horse\\nmust have caused him intense agony.\\n\\n\"By Jove!\" came the involuntary cry, \"you\\'ve got some sand! I\\'d have\\nsquealed like a stuck pig if I was asked to endure that. Who are you?\\nI\\'m Robert H. Benson, Mr. Marten\\'s private secretary.\"\\n\\n\"My name is Power,\" was the answer, in a thick murmur.\\n\\n\"Bower?\"\\n\\n\"No--Power.\"\\n\\n\"Not John Darien Power, who was at Sacramento!\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Gee whizz! I\\'ve written you several letters. You remember my initials,\\nR. H. B.?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Can you talk? Say if you\\'d rather not.\"\\n\\n\"No, no. It\\'s all right. Anyhow--I\\'d--sooner--try.\"\\n\\n\"Does the boss know you\\'re here?\"\\n\\n\"I guess not. I wrote him--to Denver; but he\\'s been engaged--otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Ra-ther! Getting wed. You\\'ve heard? I\\'m sure you\\'re as much surprised\\nas any of us. You could have knocked me down with a feather when he told\\nme why I was wired to come West by next train from New York. \\'I want you\\nto take hold,\\' he said. \\'I\\'m off to Europe for six months on my wedding\\ntrip.\\' That was the day before yesterday, and here he\\'s gone already! I\\nhad a sort of notion, too, that our beloved employer would never take\\nunto himself a wife, or, if he did, that the U. S. A. would hear about\\nit.\"\\n\\nA hard smile illuminated the pallor of Power\\'s face. \"Marten doesn\\'t\\nhire a brass band when he has any startling proposition in mind,\" he\\nsaid.\\n\\nBenson laughed. He was a cheerful, outspoken youngster--exactly the kind\\nof private secretary the secretive millionaire might have been expected\\nto avoid like the plague, if Marten had not chosen him deliberately\\nbecause of those very qualities.\\n\\n\"No,\" he chuckled. \"You and I know that, don\\'t we? But signing on for a\\nwife is a different matter to securing an option on a placer mine. I\\nshould have thought there would be things doing when H. M. joined the\\nnoble army of benedicts, especially after he had sorted out such a\\ndaisy.... Sorry, Power! The peak of this saddle must be dashed\\nuncomfortable. And, perhaps, I\\'m not carrying you to rights. One ought\\nto be taught these things. Now, a cavalry soldier would be trained in\\nthe art of picking up a wounded mate, and in carrying him, too.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not far. I can last out.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t mind having a pow-wow? Guess you prefer it? You knew Miss\\nWillard, I suppose? By the way, were you coming to the wedding?\"\\n\\n\"No. I am here by chance.\"\\n\\n\"Well, of course, I rather fancied that. If I had been asked offhand how\\nmuch time that Sacramento job would use up, I should have said another\\nthree months, at least. Is all the machinery there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Pumps, and all?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Sorry if I appear inquisitive, but----\"\\n\\n\"The pumps are working. I got a hustle on the contractors.\"\\n\\n\"Great Scott! I should think so, indeed. They\\'ll make a song about it in\\nChicago. Have you sent in the consulting engineer\\'s certificate?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. It\\'s in Denver.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll tell you something that is good for broken legs. The boss was\\ntalking of you only yesterday. He said you were to collect five\\nthousand dollars when that placer mine was in shape. He forgets\\nnothing, does he?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\\nPower\\'s stricken state was sufficient excuse for any seeming lack of\\ngratitude, and his rescuer\\'s mind reverted to the more immediate topic\\nof the marriage.\\n\\n\"I asked if you were acquainted with Miss Willard,\" he went on.\\n\"Naturally, you must have seen her often. She was born and bred on this\\nranch, I believe.\"\\n\\n\"Bred here, yes; but born near Pueblo, I\\'ve been told.\"\\n\\n\"Say, isn\\'t she a peach?\"\\n\\n\"A pretty girl, very.\"\\n\\n\"Rather quiet, though. Kind of subdued, to my taste. Life on the Dolores\\nranch must have been a mighty tough proposition, I imagine. But she\\'ll\\nbrighten up as Mrs. Marten. They all do.\"\\n\\n\"Is Marten a sultan, then?\"\\n\\nThe private secretary chortled over the joke. \"I\\'m jiggered if I could\\nhave pulled off a wheeze like that if I had been chucked off a cliff and\\nmy leg was out of gear!\" he cried. \"No, my boy, Marten has a clean\\nrecord in that respect. I\\'ve never known him look twice at any woman;\\nthough he\\'s had chances in plenty. What I mean is that these sweet young\\nthings who have never seen a real store, and don\\'t know sable from dyed\\nrabbit, wake up amazingly when they\\'re Mrs. Somebody of Somewhere. Look\\nat Mrs. Van Pieter! A year ago she was keeping tab on people who hired\\nher father\\'s canoes at Portland, Maine, and it\\'s hardly a week since I\\nmet her in Tiffany\\'s, matching pearls at a thousand dollars a pick.\"\\n\\n\"What were you doing in Tiffany\\'s?\"\\n\\nThe question seemed to take Benson by surprise; but, though he might be\\ntalkative as a parrot, he did not discuss his employer\\'s personal\\nbehests.\\n\\n\"Having a look around,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I thought you might be buying Mrs. Marten\\'s wedding gift,\" went on\\nPower.\\n\\n\"Well, as a guesser, you\\'d come out first in a prize competition.\"\\n\\n\"It was--just--curiosity. I wondered--what--Marten gave her.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s no secret. She wore it today. A collarette of diamonds.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, a collar! Has it a golden padlock? Is there a leash?\"\\n\\n\"Say, now! Aren\\'t you feeling pretty bad? We\\'re going downhill, and it\\njolts. But we\\'re near that store. What\\'s the name?\"\\n\\n\"MacGonigal\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure. I had forgotten. Queer fellow, the proprietor. Looks like a\\ncharacter out of one of Bret Harte\\'s novels. Is there a doctor in\\nBison?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--of a sort. He\\'s sober, some days.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s hope this is one of the days.\"\\n\\n\"Drunk or sober, he can pull a leg straight and tie it in splints.\"\\n\\n\"But it ought to be fixed in plaster of Paris. That\\'s the latest dodge.\\nThen you\\'ll be able to hobble about in less than a month. Why, here\\'s\\nthe storekeeper himself. He must have been looking this way.\"\\n\\n\"He was expecting me. I promised to meet him about four o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'re on time.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks to you.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, come off! A lot I\\'ve done; though I do believe it was better to\\nkeep up a steady flow of chatter than to be asking you every ten yards\\nhow you were feeling.... Hi, there! I\\'ve brought your friend Power; but\\nhe\\'s in rather bad shape. Had a fall up in the Gulch, and one leg is\\ncrocked.\"\\n\\nThe pony needed no urging to halt, and Power, whose head was sunk\\nbetween his shoulders, looked as if he would become insensible again at\\nthe mere thought of renewed exertion.\\n\\n\"A fall!\" repeated MacGonigal, moving ponderously to the near side, and\\npeering up into Power\\'s face. \"Well, ef I ain\\'t dog-goned! What sort of\\na fall?\"\\n\\n\"Just the common variety--downward,\" said Benson. \"His left leg is\\nbroken below the knee. Can you hold him until I hitch this fiery steed\\nto a post? Then I\\'ll help carry him to a bedroom. After that, if I can\\nbe of any use, tell me what to do, or where to go--for the doctor, I\\nmean.\"\\n\\nBy this time MacGonigal had assured himself that Power\\'s clothing was\\nnot full of bullet-holes, and he began to believe that Benson, whom he\\nrecognized, was telling the truth.\\n\\n\"Give him to me,\" he said, with an air of quiet self-confidence. \"Back\\nof some sugar casks in the warehouse thar you\\'ll find a stretcher.\\nBring that along, an\\' we\\'ll lay him in the veranda till the doc shows\\nup.\"\\n\\nSoon the hardly conscious sufferer was reposing with some degree of\\ncomfort in a shaded nook with his back to the light. MacGonigal, whose\\nactions were strangely deft-handed and gentle for so stout a man, was\\npersuading him to drink some brandy.\\n\\n\"He has collapsed all at once,\" said Benson commiseratingly. \"He perked\\nup and chatted in great shape while I was bringing him through the\\nGulch.\"\\n\\n\"Did he now?... Yes, Derry, it\\'s me, Mac. Just another mouthful.... An\\'\\nwhat did he talk about, Mr. Benson?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, mostly about the wedding, I guess.\"\\n\\n\"Nat\\'rally. He\\'d be kind of interested in hearin\\' how Marten had scooped\\nup Nancy Willard.\"\\n\\nSome acrid quality in the storekeeper\\'s tone must have pierced the fog\\nwhich had settled on Power\\'s brain. He raised a hand to push away the\\nglass held to his lips.\\n\\n\"Say, I\\'ve only secured a broken leg, Mac,\" he murmured, smiling into\\nthe anxious face bent over him. \"I don\\'t want to be doped as well.\\nPerhaps Mr. Benson will mount that nag of his, and bring Peters.\"\\n\\n\"Look-a here, Derry, hadn\\'t we better send to Denver?\"\\n\\n\"No. Peters has set dozens of legs and arms.\"\\n\\n\"I guess he\\'s back at the ranch. He went thar, an\\' I hain\\'t seen him\\namong the crowd.\"\\n\\n\"Is he a tall, red-whiskered chap, with a nose that needs keeping out of\\nthe sun?\" broke in Benson.\\n\\n\"Yep. That\\'s him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s there now--and--not so bad. Does he really understand\\nbone-setting?\"\\n\\n\"Sure. He\\'s all to rights when not too much in likker.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have him here in half an hour.\"\\n\\nBenson whistled to the dog, and they heard the clattering hoofbeats of\\nthe cob\\'s hurried departure. MacGonigal brought a chair, and sat by his\\nfriend\\'s side.\\n\\n\"Was it a reel tumble, Derry?\" he asked softly.\\n\\n\"Seems like it, Mac. Don\\'t worry your kind old fat head. No one saw me.\\nLet me lie quiet now, there\\'s a good soul. I\\'ve done enough thinking for\\ntoday.\"\\n\\n\"Say, Boy, kin yer smoke?\"\\n\\n\"No--not till the doc is through.\"\\n\\nMacGonigal bit the end off a cigar, bit it viciously, as if he were\\nannoyed at it. Then he struck a match by drawing it sharply along the\\nside of his leg, and lit the cigar; but not another word did he utter\\nuntil a thunder of hoofs disturbed the hot silence of the afternoon.\\n\\n\"Guess that\\'s some of the boys comin\\' from the depot,\" whispered Mac.\\n\"They\\'ll not suspicion you\\'re here, Derry, an\\' I\\'ll soon have a stampede\\nby tellin\\' \\'em the doc is loose among the bottles.\"\\n\\nTrue to his promise, he got rid of the thirsty ones quickly; for this\\nsmaller batch had not even awaited the departure of the train.\\n\\n\"Air you awake, Derry?\" he inquired, when he had crept back softly to\\nhis chair.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s this yarn about One-thumb Jake shootin\\' a rattler?\"\\n\\n\"I--don\\'t know. He didn\\'t shoot me, Mac. I got slammed on a rock, good\\nand hard.\"\\n\\n\"I on\\'y axed because I\\'m nearly fed up with Jake an\\' his gun-play.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, quit it, you sleuth. Jake wouldn\\'t pull his gun on me, not even at\\nMarten\\'s bidding.\"\\n\\n\"He kin be the biggest damn fool in Bison when he\\'s loaded. Anyhow, I\\'ll\\ntake your say-so.\"\\n\\nThere was another period of quietude, when brooding thought sat heavy on\\nMacGonigal, and pain gnawed Power with its sharpest tooth. Then came the\\nsound of galloping horses again, and Benson appeared, guiding a big man\\nwho rolled in his walk; for the fast canter had stirred many varieties\\nof alcohol in an overburdened system. The private secretary\\'s voice was\\nraised in order that the others might hear.\\n\\n\"I would advise you to bandage the limb sufficiently to give Mr. Power\\nsome sort of ease until Dr. Stearn comes from Denver,\" he was urging. \"I\\nam sure that Mr. Marten would wish this case to be attended by his own\\ndoctor, and I know that Dr. Stearn attends him.\"\\n\\n\"Stearn! What does that old mutt know about surgery?\" shouted Peters. \"I\\ncould set a compound fracture while he was searching around for his\\neyeglasses.... Hullo, Mac! You\\'re always the right man in the right\\nplace. Bring me a highball, to clear the dust out of the pipes.\"\\n\\n\"You jest fix Derry first, Peters, an\\' you kin hev two highballs.\"\\n\\nThe red-whiskered man, whose medical degree was a blend of sheer\\nimpudence and a good deal of rough-and-ready experience, knew MacGonigal\\nso well that he did not attempt to argue.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" he said sulkily. \"Break up an egg box, and saw it into\\neighteen-inch lengths, four inches wide. You have a roll of lint and\\nscissors? I\\'ll rip up his trousers, and have a look at the place.\"\\n\\nHis actions were decided, but somewhat awkward. When Power winced\\nbecause of a careless handling of the injured limb, he only guffawed.\\n\\n\"Nips you a bit!\" he grunted. \"Of course it does. I\\'d like to know what\\nyou expected. Did you fancy you could flop over the Gulch like a\\ncrow?... Oh, here we are! Just an ordinary smash. Hurry up with those\\nsplints, Mac. Now, just set your teeth and grin hard while I pull....\\nThere! Did you hear it? I\\'ll not hurt you more than I can help while I\\ndo the dressing. Got any bromide in that den of yours, Mac? Well, give\\nhim a ten-grain dose every three hours till he sleeps. Get the rest of\\nhis clothes off, keep him in bed for three weeks, and the rest may be\\nleft safely to Nature. Gee whizz! I\\'m chewing mud. Where in hell do you\\nkeep your whisky?\"\\n\\n\"Doctor\" Peters had a professional manner which did not inspire\\nconfidence; but he seemed to understand what he was about, and Benson,\\nwhen he could be of no further service, went to the reduction mill,\\nwhere he had business which detained him until a late hour. Next\\nmorning, on his way to Denver, he called at the store, and visited\\nPower, who was feeling a great deal better, and was confident that the\\ndamaged limb would soon be as sound as ever.\\n\\n\"I hope you won\\'t think it necessary to trouble Mr. Marten with any\\nreport of my accident,\" went on the invalid. \"You see, in a sort of a\\nway, it happened in connection with his marriage, as I was watching the\\nfestivities when it happened--had my eyes anywhere but where they ought\\nto be, I suppose--and if his wife came to hear of it she might take it\\nto heart. Sometimes a woman has odd notions about such things occurring\\non her wedding day.\"\\n\\n\"Right you are,\" agreed Benson cheerfully.\\n\\nA remark dropped by the manager of the mill had supplied a reason for\\nthe young engineer\\'s interest in the marriage, and he had come to the\\nconclusion that the sooner the whole affair was forgotten the better it\\nwould be for all parties.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be in Denver till September or thereabouts; but I\\'ll be seeing you\\nlong before then,\" he continued. \"What about squaring your account? I\\nthink I have all the details in the office.\"\\n\\n\"Pay what is coming to me by check to Smith & Moffat\\'s bank,\" said\\nPower. \"They\\'ll let me know when they get the money, and you can mail a\\nreceipt here for my signature. By the way, I wish to resign my position\\non Marten\\'s staff as from yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Sorry to hear that. Do you really mean it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll put that through, also. Goodby, old chap, and good luck.\\nYou\\'ll be well looked after, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t be in better hands than Mac\\'s. If he didn\\'t own a hard head,\\nhis big heart would have ruined him long ago.\"\\n\\n\"An unusual combination,\" laughed Benson, and his eyes met Power\\'s\\nquizzically. \"Well, so long! Let me know if I can do anything.\"\\n\\nBeyond the purely business formalities connected with the payment of\\nPower\\'s salary and the acceptance of his resignation, Benson heard\\nlittle of him until ten days later, when a telegram reached him in the\\nearly morning. It was from MacGonigal, and read:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t like the look of Power\\'s leg. Send doctor.\"\\n\\nThat afternoon Benson brought Dr. Stearn to the store, and MacGonigal\\nexplained that from some remark grunted by Peters when quite sober, and\\nfrom personal observation, he was not satisfied with the appearance of\\nPower\\'s injured limb. The doctor, a fully qualified medical man, was\\nvery wroth with Peters when he had made a brief examination of the\\npatient.\\n\\n\"This is the work of an incompetent quack,\" he said angrily. \"Whoever\\nthe man may be, he is the worst sort of idiot--the sort that knows a\\nlittle of what he is doing. The splints and bandaging have served their\\npurpose only too well, because callous is forming already. Unless you\\nwish to have one leg half an inch shorter than the other during the rest\\nof your life, Mr. Power, you must let me put you under ether.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" came the calm-voiced question.\\n\\n\"To put it plainly, your leg should be broken again, and properly set.\"\\n\\n\"What is wrong with it?\"\\n\\n\"You know you have two bones in that part of the leg which is below the\\nknee, the tibia and the fibula? Well, they were broken--by a blow, was\\nit? No, a fall--well, they practically amount to the same thing, though\\nthere are indications that this injury was caused by a blow----\"\\n\\n\"He fell off one rock onto another, doctor,\" put in Benson.\\n\\n\"Ah, yes! That accounts for it. As I was saying, they were broken\\nslantwise, and now, instead of being in correct apposition, the upper\\nparts override the lower ones. Do you follow?\"\\n\\n\"Suppose they are not interfered with, will they heal all right?\" said\\nPower.\\n\\n\"Y-yes,\" came the grudging admission; \"but you\\'ll walk with a limp.\"\\n\\n\"Bar that, the left leg will be as strong as the right one?\"\\n\\n\"Stronger, in that particular place. Nature does some first-rate\\ngrafting, when the stock is young and exceptionally healthy.\"\\n\\nPower smiled, almost with the compelling good-humor of other days. \"Then\\nI\\'ll limp along, Doctor,\" he said. \"I have things to do, and this\\nenforced waste of time is the worst feature of the whole business. It is\\nvery good of you to come out here, and more than kind of Mr. Benson to\\naccompany you; but I won\\'t, if I can avoid it, endure another ten days\\nlike the sample I have just passed through.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll regret your decision later. There\\'s no means of adding that half\\ninch afterward, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I quite understand, Doctor. It\\'s a limp for life.\"\\n\\nDr. Stearn felt the calf muscles and tendons again, and pressed the\\nregion of the fracture with skilled gentleness.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity,\" he growled. \"You\\'ve made a wonderful recovery. If, when\\nyou are able to hobble about, you meet this rascal, Peters, and shoot\\nhim, call me as a witness in your behalf. It would be a clear case of\\njustifiable homicide!\"\\n\\nSo that is how John Darien Power acquired the somewhat jerky movement\\nwhich characterizes his walk today; though the cause of it is blurred by\\nthe mists of a quarter of a century. The red-whiskered Peters was shot\\nlong ago, not by Power, but by an infuriated miner from whose jaw he had\\nwrenched two sound teeth before discovering the decayed stump which led\\nto this display of misplaced energy. It was well that such impostors\\nshould be swept out of the townlets of Colorado, even if the means\\nadopted for their suppression were drastic. They wrought untold mischief\\nby their pretensions, and brought hundreds of men and women to needless\\ndeath. They did some little good, perhaps, in communities where\\nphysicians and surgeons were few and far between; but their rough and\\npartly successful carpentry of the human frame did not atone for the\\nmisery they inflicted in cases which demanded a delicately exact and\\nscientific diagnosis. At any rate, they have gone, never to be seen\\nagain in Colorado, and the precise manner of their departure, whether\\nby rum, or lead, or wise and far-reaching laws, does not concern this\\nnarrative.\\n\\nWhat does concern it most intimately is the first use Power made of his\\nlimping steps; for upon their direction and daily increasing number\\ndepended the whole of his subsequent history. Life still held for him\\ncertain rare and noteworthy phases--developments which, when viewed\\nthrough the vista of many years, seemed as inevitable and preordained as\\nthe ordered sequence of a Greek tragedy. Yet, on the day he hobbled out\\ninto the sunshine again, it was just the spin of a coin whether he rode\\nto the Dolores ranch or took train for Denver, and it is safe to say\\nthat had he done the one thing instead of the other his future career\\nmust have been drawn into an entirely different channel.\\n\\nAt least, that is the way men reason when they review the past, and\\nsingle out some trivial act which apparently governed their destinies;\\nwhereat, in all probability, the gods smile pityingly, for the lives of\\nsome men cannot be the outcome of idle chance, and John Darien Power\\'s\\nlife was assuredly no commonplace one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nTHE SUDDEN RISE OF PETER MACGONIGAL\\n\\n\\nA four-wheeled buggy, with springs, the only vehicle of its kind in\\nBison, had been hired for Power\\'s first outing. During a whole week\\ntoward the close of July he had stumped about on a crutch, and, when the\\ngreat day arrived that he was able to crawl slowly to and fro in the\\nveranda with the aid of a stick, he announced to the watchful MacGonigal\\nthat henceforth he was \"on the job again.\"\\n\\nOn that memorable occasion, while Derry was showing off the new-found\\naccomplishment of walking, an elderly man, white-haired and wiry, but of\\nsmall stature, rode by on a mettlesome mustang. Power\\'s face grew hard\\nwhen he met the rider\\'s stare of astonishment; but the expression fled\\ninstantly, and he waved a friendly greeting, which, however, received\\nthe curtest of responses, while the horse unexpectedly found his head\\nfree for a canter.\\n\\nMacGonigal, whose big eyes lost nothing within range, noted the bare nod\\nwhich acknowledged Power\\'s salute.\\n\\n\"Old man Willard held out the marble mitt that-a time, Derry,\" said he.\\n\\nPower did not reply for a moment. When he answered, he quoted Dryden\\'s\\ncouplet:\\n\\n  \"Forgiveness to the injured doth belong;\\n  But they ne\\'er pardon who have done the wrong.\"\\n\\n\"Good fer you, Derry!\" exclaimed the storekeeper appreciatively. \"I\\'ve\\noften wondered what you was connin\\' to yerself up thar,\" and he jerked\\nhis head in the direction of Power\\'s bedroom; \"but I never allowed it\\nwas po\\'try.\"\\n\\n\"You were not mistaken, Mac. I was hard at work on dry prose. Those\\nlines are not mine. They were written before Colorado was christened,\\nand they will be true until men attain the millennium.\"\\n\\n\"Huh!\"\\n\\nMacGonigal took refuge in a noncommittal grunt, because he fancied that\\nthe millennium was the name of a Chicago vaudeville house, and, somehow,\\nthe notion did not seem to fit into its right place in the conversation.\\n\\n\"For all that,\" mused Power aloud, \"I\\'ll call on Mr. Francis Willard,\\ntomorrow.\"\\n\\nSo this resolution explained the light conveyance standing outside the\\nstore next morning. Power was in the act of settling himself as\\ncomfortably as might be beside the driven, when One-thumb Jake galloped\\ndown the <DW72> leading from the Gulch. The cowboy pulled up in the\\napproved style of his tribe, swung out of the saddle, and banged into\\nthe veranda a decrepit portmanteau, which he had been carrying in the\\nthumbless hand.\\n\\n\"Room an\\' drink fer a single gent!\" he shouted. \"I\\'m an orfin, I am, a\\npore weak critter slung out inter a crool world!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re never leaving the Willard outfit, Jake?\" said Power, who might\\nwell be surprised, since the man had been connected with the Dolores\\nranch since the first lot of cattle was turned loose on its pastures.\\n\\n\"That\\'s about the size of it,\" said the other.\\n\\n\"But why?\"\\n\\n\"The old man says, \\'Git!\\' an\\' I got.\"\\n\\n\"No reason?\"\\n\\n\"Wall, if you squeeze it outer me, I\\'ll be squoze. In a sort of a way,\\nit had ter do with you.\"\\n\\n\"With me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. The boss says ter me yestiddy, \\'Why is Derry Power hangin\\'\\nroun\\' Mac\\'s?\\' Says I, \\'He bruk his leg.\\' \\'Pity he didn\\'t break his\\nneck,\\' says the boss, an\\', seein\\' as you\\'se a friend of mine, I didn\\'t\\nagree with any sich sentiments, an\\' tole him the same. He kind o\\' curled\\nup then; but this mornin\\' he gev me the perlite push,--said as he was\\nquittin\\' Bison fer a spell, an\\' the ranch would be shut down. Anyways,\\nDerry, I\\'m mighty glad ter see you hoppin\\' aroun\\'. Git down outer that\\nrig, an\\' hev a sociable drink.\"\\n\\nPower consulted his watch, and seemed to arrive at some decision on the\\nspur of the moment.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t wait now,\" he said. \"You\\'ll be here this evening?\"\\n\\n\"Sure.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll be around, and I may table a proposition that will please\\nyou. Jim,\" this to the driver, \"beat it to the depot. I want to make the\\nten o\\'clock to Denver, and we have only twenty minutes.\"\\n\\nMacGonigal, as usual a silent auditor, gazed after the cloud of dust\\nraised by horse and buggy, and was minded, perhaps, to say something.\\nWhatever may have been his first intent, he repressed it.\\n\\n\"What\\'s yer pizen, Jake?\" he inquired, and the cowboy named it.\\n\\nLate that night Power returned. He was so tired that he had practically\\nto be carried to bed; but he contrived to tell the storekeeper that Jake\\nshould remain in Bison at his (Power\\'s) expense until certain business\\nconditions had developed. Next day he was too exhausted to take any\\nexercise; but sat in the veranda after breakfast, smoking and chatting\\nwith the habitues, whose varied surmises he shared, when a stranger\\nwhizzed through the township in the buggy, vanished in the direction of\\nthe Gulch, and returned with equal celerity of movement a couple of\\nhours subsequently.\\n\\n\"Looks like a lawyer,\" said some wiseacre. \"Them fellers air allus on a\\nhair-trigger when a mortgage falls in.\"\\n\\n\"Is Willard\\'s time up?\" inquired another man.\\n\\n\"Thar was talk about it afore this dry spell kem an\\' cleared him out. Of\\ncourse----\"\\n\\nThe speaker stopped suddenly. He was on the point of alluding to Nancy\\'s\\nmarriage, when he remembered that Power was present, and, in such\\ncircumstances, it is safe to assume that a gathering of rough western\\nminers will display more real courtesy and consideration for the\\nfeelings of others than may be forthcoming in far more pretentious\\ncircles.\\n\\n\"No need to trip your tongue on my account,\" laughed Power, reaching\\nlazily for a glass of milk and seltzer. \"You were going to say, I\\nsuppose, that when Mr. Willard\\'s daughter married a rich man the\\nmortgage difficulty would disappear.\"\\n\\n\"Somethin\\' like that, Derry,\" was the answer.\\n\\n\"Did you ever hear the amount of the mortgage?\"\\n\\n\"Five thousand, I was told.\"\\n\\nPower laughed again. \"Five thousand!\" he cried. \"Surely Nancy Willard\\ncost more than that! Why, Marten gave me that amount as a rake-off on\\none job I put through for him this spring.\"\\n\\nThe words were bitter as gall, though uttered in a tone of quiet banter.\\nNone spoke in reply. Each man there had seen Power and the girl\\nscampering together through Bison on their ponies so often that the two\\nwere marked down by good-natured gossip as \"made for each other.\"\\nSympathy now would be useless and misplaced; so there was silence for\\nawhile, until a safer and collectively interesting topic was broached by\\nMacGonigal.\\n\\n\"Kin anybody here tell me what\\'s going on at the mill?\" he asked\\nsuddenly.\\n\\nThe \"mill,\" as the agency through which many thousands of tons of\\nlow-grade telluride ore were transmuted weekly into a certain number of\\nounces of gold and silver, was the breath of life to Bison. If it\\nstopped, the greater part of the little town\\'s inhabitants was aware\\ninstantly of bare cupboards and empty pockets. Work might cease at the\\nmines for varying periods without causing vital harm to the community;\\nbut the metal pulses of the mill must beat with regularity, or Bison\\nsuffered from a severe form of heart disease. Consequently, there was no\\nrush to volunteer information; though some of those present had had\\ntheir suspicions that all was not as it should be with the giant whose\\nclamant voice rang ever in their ears.\\n\\n\"Some books and things was carted from the office to Denver\\na-Wednesday,\" said the know-all who had spoken about the mortgage.\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\nThe storekeeper\\'s tone was ominous, and the other man grinned uneasily.\\n\\n\"Guess it\\'s what they call an audit,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Thar\\'s been two audits a year fer ten years at Bison, an\\' the books hev\\nnever gone ter Denver afore.\"\\n\\n\"Page has been nosin\\' around, too, like as if he was takin\\' stock,\" put\\nin a feeder, whose task it was to guide and shovel ore into the rolls.\\n\\n\"Page oughter know what\\'s in the mill by this time,\" said MacGonigal,\\nand indeed, the personage under discussion being the manager, the\\nstatement was almost excessively accurate.\\n\\n\"Thar was talk in the papers awhile sence about some new process fer\\ntreatin\\' low-grade ores,\" commented the feeder, apropos of nothing in\\nparticular. Then he seemed to wake into cheerful activity. \"But what\\'s\\nthe use o\\' meetin\\' trouble halfways?\" he cried. \"Goldarn it! people said\\nthe mines was peterin\\' out more\\'n a year ago, an\\' we\\'re workin\\' full\\nspell this yer week.... Who\\'s fer a fizz? I go on at six, an\\' I hev to\\neat a line fust.\"\\n\\nThat evening, before the store filled with the day men, and Power alone\\nwas listening, MacGonigal was more outspoken.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve a notion that the mill is goin\\' ter close down, Derry,\" he said\\nglumly.\\n\\n\"Probably, for a time,\" said Power.\\n\\nSuch prompt agreement was unexpected; but MacGonigal passed it without\\ncomment.\\n\\n\"Nit--fer good. They lost the main vein a year last Christmas, an\\' the\\ntreatin\\' of ounce ore has been a bluff whiles they s\\'arched high an\\' low\\nbeyond the fault. No, Derry, Bison is busted. Me for Denver tomorrow,\\nan\\' any fellar kin hev this store at a vallyation, wid a good rake-off,\\ntoo--dang it!\"\\n\\nPower was smoking placidly, and the gloomy prophecy of his friend did\\nnot appear to disturb him. He even affected to ignore the sigh with\\nwhich MacGonigal turned away after gazing at him with an expression akin\\nto dismay; for the stout man had the constitutional dislike of his kind\\nto change, and the store had yielded a steady income since the inception\\nof Bison.\\n\\n\"Say, Mac,\" said Power after a long pause, \"if you were to dig deep down\\ninto your pants, how much could you ante up?\"\\n\\n\"Eight thousand dollars, ef I kep\\' a grubstake,\" came the instant\\nresponse.\\n\\n\"And what is the mill worth?\"\\n\\n\"It cost the best part of a hundred an\\' fifty thousand.\"\\n\\n\"I asked you what it is worth.\"\\n\\n\"What it\\'ll fetch.\"\\n\\n\"Can you figure it out?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s on\\'y the movable plant. A lot of money is sunk in cyanide vats,\\nan\\' rails, an\\' buildin\\'s. Guess, when you come ter whittle it down ter\\nrolls an\\' engines, less the cost of takin\\' \\'em ter pieces an\\' fixin\\'\\n\\'em anywhar, you\\'d git \\'em fer twenty thousand.\"\\n\\n\"And plenty, too, for a mill erected ten years ago to deal with\\nhigh-grade ore. You see, Mac, the scientific treatment of rich ores has\\ndeveloped so rapidly of late that the Bison mill is practically a back\\nnumber; while we know that it cannot compete with the low-grade\\nextractions now practised in <DW36> Creek and at Leadville. No, you\\nmust cut down your estimate. When you buy that mill, Mac, you shouldn\\'t\\nspring a cent beyond fifteen thousand, and begin by offering ten. At\\nbest, it would only form a nucleus for real work.\"\\n\\n\"Me--buy--the--mill!\" MacGonigal permitted himself to be astounded to\\nthe point of stupefaction.\\n\\n\"Yes, that is what will happen. But not a word of this to anyone. Start\\nin and sell the store, by all means; provided you fix its value on the\\nbasis of live business, likely to improve.\"\\n\\n\"Derry, air you wool-gatherin\\', or what?\"\\n\\n\"Unless I am greatly mistaken, Mac, you and I will gather as much wool\\nduring the next twelve months as we are likely to need for the remainder\\nof our lives. I may be wrong, of course, but you will be perfectly safe.\\nYou will grab the mill at its breaking-up price, and you should sell the\\nstore in any event. All I ask is that you act strictly according to my\\ninstructions. It is hardly necessary to repeat that you must keep the\\nproposition to yourself.\"\\n\\nThese two knew each other thoroughly; though MacGonigal was well aware\\nthat certain unfathomable characteristics had developed of late in the\\nonce carefree and even-minded youngster for whom he felt an almost\\nparental tenderness. He made no reply. He asked no question. He knew\\nthat when the time came Power would speak, but not until the scheme he\\nhad in mind, whatever it might be, was ripe for action. Indeed, ever\\nsince the accident, Power had displayed some of the attributes which\\ncaused men to hate and fear Marten. He, whose laugh had been the\\nmerriest and human sympathies the most marked among all the men who had\\npassed in review before the storekeeper\\'s bulbous eyes, was now apt to\\nlapse into a cold cynicism, an aloofness of interest, a smiling contempt\\nfor the opinions and wishes of his fellows, which had puzzled and\\nsaddened his one stanch friend. But MacGonigal\\'s confidence in him had\\nnot diminished. Rather was he aware of a broadening and strengthening of\\nqualities already remarkable, and he hugged the belief that, as the\\nimage of Nancy Willard faded into impenetrable mists, Power would come\\nback to his erstwhile sane and wholesome outlook on life.\\n\\nSo the stout man did not even trouble to put into words the assurance\\nthat he might be trusted to hold his tongue as to possible occurrences\\nat Bison. After a prolonged stare at a glorious sunset which silhouetted\\nthe Rocky Mountains in a rich tint of ultramarine against a sky of\\ncrimson and gold, he executed that unaided transit of a cigar across his\\nmouth for which he was noted, and when he spoke it was only to assure\\nthe section of Colorado visible through the door that he was dog-goned.\\n\\nThereafter events moved with the swiftness which at times seems to\\npossess the most out-of-the-way places in America like a fever.\\n\\nThe stranger whose guise suggested a lawyer to the quidnuncs of Bison\\nwas not seen again in the township during the ensuing fortnight; but\\naffrighting rumor, which soon became deadly fact, told of the mill\\nclosing down for lack of paying ore. Mr. Page, Marten\\'s representative,\\npromised the sorrowing people that work would be found for everyone\\nelsewhere. Though this guarantee alleviated the crushing effect of the\\nblow, there was much grieving over the loss of more or less comfortable\\nhomes which had been won from the wilderness by years of patient effort.\\nMen and women, even in strenuous America, twine their heartstrings\\naround stocks and stones, and the threatened upheaval was grievous to\\nthem. It meant the breaking up of families and friendships, a\\ntransference to new districts and a strange environment, a scattering of\\nthe household gods which might never reassemble in the old and familiar\\norder. Amid the general unrest none gave much heed to the news that the\\nDolores ranch had found a new owner--who, by the way, according to the\\njoyous version of the foreman, One-thumb Jake, meant to raise horses\\ninstead of cattle--but all Bison felt its hair lifting in amazement when\\nthe _Rocky Mountain News_ announced that Mr. Hugh Marten had sold the\\nmill to Mr. Peter MacGonigal for a sum unnamed, but variously estimated\\nbetween the ridiculous (though actual) price of twelve thousand dollars\\n(toward which one-half was contributed by a mortgage on mill and ranch)\\nand five times the amount as representing its cheap acquisition as a\\ngoing concern.\\n\\nEvery practical miner knew that the ore bodies in the mines were\\nexhausted, and many and quaint were the opinions privately uttered as to\\nMac\\'s sanity. Even the astute Page--once the deeds were signed and the\\nmoney paid--expressed the hope that the storekeeper would not rue his\\nbargain.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" he said diplomatically, \"you may find purchasers for some\\nof the plant; but milling machinery is a special thing, and you will be\\nlucky if you sell the stuff soon. I suppose you have a purpose in view\\nfor the buildings?\"\\n\\n\"Guess there\\'s some stuff ter be found in the tailin\\'s, an\\' a few\\npockets of ore in the mines,\" said MacGonigal.\\n\\nThe manager shook his head. \"You can take it from me that when Marten\\nsucks an orange there isn\\'t much juice left for the next fellow,\" he\\nsaid. \"You bought the place with your eyes open, and I still think you\\nmay get your money back, with a small profit; but I advise you strongly\\nnot to lose a day in advertising the rolls and accessories, while the\\nman who has taken over the Dolores ranch may buy the buildings. They\\nwill come in useful as barns.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll chew on that proposition,\" said MacGonigal.\\n\\nPage thought him slightly cracked; but shook hands affably, and caught\\nthe next train for Denver. He was completely flabbergasted when an\\nassistant whom he had deputed to superintend the removal of Bison\\'s\\ncitizens to new spheres of labor informed him that Messrs. Power and\\nMacGonigal were signing on the whole of the miners and mill-hands at\\nestablished rates of pay, and that operations were to be started\\nforthwith on a new strike in the Gulch. When he had recovered somewhat\\nfrom the shock of this announcement he strolled into the government\\nrecord offices, and examined the registry of recent mining claims. There\\nhe found that a location certificate had been obtained by John Darien\\nPower for 1,500 feet by 300 feet on a well defined crevice, at least 10\\nfeet deep, situated in the Gulch, Dolores Ranch, Bison, in the county of\\nBison and state of Colorado. Other certificates had been issued to cover\\nmore than a mile of the main contact, and, to clench the mining right,\\nJohn Darien Power figured as the legal owner of the land. In a word, he\\nwas \"a valid discoverer\" on his own property.\\n\\nPage was a shrewd man, and he did not commit the error of\\nunderestimating the ability of the rival who had engineered this subtle\\nstroke.\\n\\n\"I\\'m buncoed this time, and no mistake,\" he muttered, and hurried back\\nto his office, pallid with wrath and foreboding.\\n\\nThere he met Benson, and told him what had happened. The private\\nsecretary, rather staggered at first, regained his complacency when he\\nhad glanced through some letters and cablegrams received from their\\ncommon chief.\\n\\n\"The boss has approved of every move in the game,\" he said, with a\\nhalf-hearted laugh. \"You see, here he authorizes us to take even less\\nthan MacGonigal paid for the mill, and, when Willard repaid the loan, he\\nrefused to accept it, but cabled that the money was a gift from Mrs.\\nMarten. So I don\\'t think he can hold us responsible.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not the responsibility I\\'m kicking at, but the smooth way in\\nwhich I was bested,\" growled Page. \"Now, who\\'d have thought Power had it\\nin him?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I would, for one,\" said Benson.\\n\\n\"Why, you hardly knew him.\"\\n\\n\"I met him under exceptional conditions.\"\\n\\n\"But how the deuce did he manage to locate that lost vein--I suppose\\nthat is what he has found?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it was a gift from the gods.\"\\n\\n\"I do wish you\\'d talk sense,\" said the irritated manager.\\n\\n\"What _you_ would call sense might not pass for wisdom on Olympus,\"\\nsmiled Benson.\\n\\n\"Will you kindly tell me what you are driving at?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t. But look here, Page--which of us is going to write this story\\nto the boss?\"\\n\\n\"You are, and don\\'t forget to put in those remarks of yours. They\\'ll\\nhelp some.\"\\n\\n\"Shouldn\\'t I cable? Marten may want to know of this new move.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I suppose that is the right thing to do. When you have coded the\\nmessage, I\\'ll go through it with you. There must be no mistake this\\ntime.\"\\n\\nThus, within a few hours, Hugh Marten, established at the Meurice in\\nParis, received news which certainly took him aback; for he was a man\\nwho seldom brooked a successful interloper. At first he was annoyed, and\\nhad it in mind to discharge Page by cablegram. There would be no\\ndifficulty in giving \"Messrs. Power and MacGonigal\" a good deal of legal\\ntrouble. To begin with, the lawyers would allege collusion against Page,\\nand an investigation into the purchase of the ranch might reveal\\nloopholes for legal stilettos. Indeed, his alert brain was canvassing\\nall manner of chicanery possible through statutes made and enacted when\\nhis wife came in, flushed and breathless.\\n\\n\"Hugh,\" she cried, \"I\\'ve had heaps of fun this afternoon! Madame de\\nNeuville brought me to the Duchesse de Brasnes\\' place in that quaint old\\nFaubourg St. Germain, and the Duchesse took such a fancy to me that we\\nare invited for a week-end shoot at her castle, one of the real chateaux\\non the Loire. You\\'ll come, of course?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, Nancy.\"\\n\\n\"You say yes as though I had asked you to go to the dentist.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m a trifle worried, and that\\'s the fact.\"\\n\\n\"What is it? Can I help?\"\\n\\nMarten hesitated; though only for an instant. His wife was more adorable\\nthan ever since she had discovered what wonders an illimitable purse\\ncould achieve in the _boutiques_ of the Rue de la Paix; but there was\\never at the back of his mind a suspicion that she looked on her past\\nlife as a thing that was dead, and was schooling herself to an\\nartificial gaiety in these glittering surroundings of rank and fashion.\\n\\n\"The truth is that I am vexed at something which has happened in\\nColorado--at Bison,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You have had no ill news of Dad?\" she cried, in quick alarm.\\n\\n\"No, he\\'s all right. I told you he had sold the ranch. Well, the\\npurchaser is that young engineer, Derry Power.\"\\n\\nHe watched her closely; but trust any woman to mislead a man when she\\nknows that her slightest change of expression will be marked and\\nunderstood. Mrs. Marten\\'s eyes opened wide, and she had no difficulty in\\nfeigning honest surprise.\\n\\n\"Derry Power!\" she almost gasped. \"What in the world does he want with\\nthe ranch?\"\\n\\n\"It seems that he contrived to find the main vein which we lost in the\\nEsperanza mine.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, is that it?\" She was indifferent, almost bored. Her mind was in the\\nvalley of the Loire.\\n\\n\"Yes. That idiot Page was kept in the dark very neatly; so he sold the\\nmill at a scrap price--by my instructions, I admit--and now Power and\\nMacGonigal have everything in their own hands.\"\\n\\nNancy\\'s eyebrows arched, and she laughed gleefully. \"Just fancy Mac\\nblossoming into a mining magnate!\" she cried. \"But why should this\\naffair worry you, Hugh?\"\\n\\nHis hard features softened into a smile--in this instance, a real\\nsmile--for he was intensely proud of his pretty wife.\\n\\n\"I hate to feel that I have got the worst of a deal,\" he admitted. \"But\\nthat\\'s all right, Nancy. We won\\'t quarrel with old friends at Bison. Run\\naway and write to your duchess while I concoct a cable.\"\\n\\nAnd so it came to pass that Page, instead of receiving a curt dismissal,\\nwas told to place no obstacles in the way of the new venture, but rather\\nto facilitate it by fixing a reasonable price on land and houses not\\ncovered by the sale of the mill, should they be needed by Marten\\'s\\nsuccessors at Bison. In fact, by an unexampled display of good will on\\nthe part of his employer, he was bade to offer these properties to\\nPower at a valuation. That somewhat simple though generous proposal had\\na highly important sequel when Francis Willard, rendered furious by\\nlearning how he had been ousted from the ranch, sought legal aid to\\nbegin a suit against Power. Even his own lawyer counseled abandonment of\\nthe law when the facts were inquired into. Power\\'s title was\\nindisputable, and Marten\\'s action in selling the mill, no less than his\\nreadiness to make over other portions of the real estate if desired,\\nshowed that the whole undertaking had been carried through in an open\\nand businesslike way.\\n\\nWillard was convinced against his will; but, being a narrow-minded and\\nselfish man, who had not scrupled to imperil his daughter\\'s happiness\\nwhen a wealthy suitor promised to extricate him from financial troubles,\\nthe passive dislike he harbored against Power now became an active and\\nvindictive hatred. He believed, perhaps he had honestly convinced\\nhimself of this, that the young engineer had secured the estate by a\\ntrick. It was not true, of course, because he had jumped at the chance\\nof a sale when approached by the Denver lawyer acting for Power. But a\\nsoured and rancorous nature could not wholly stifle the prickings of\\nremorse. He knew that he had forced his daughter into a loveless\\nmarriage; he could not forget the girl\\'s wan despair when no answer came\\nfrom Sacramento to her letters; he had experienced all the misery of a\\ncraven-hearted thief when he stole the letters Power sent to Bison until\\nMarten assured him that equally effective measures at the other end had\\nsuppressed Nancy\\'s correspondence also. Because these things were\\nunforgivable he could not forgive the man against whom they were\\nplanned. Penury and failing health had driven him to adopt the only sure\\nmeans by which he could break off the tacit engagement which opposed a\\nbarrier to his scheming; but the knowledge that he had sinned was an\\never-present torture. A certain order of mind, crabbed, ungenerous,\\nself-seeking, may still be plagued by a lively conscience, and Willard\\'s\\nenmity against Power could be measured only by his own fiercely\\nrepressed sufferings.\\n\\n\"Curse the fellow!\" he said bitterly, when the lawyer told him that a\\nsuit for recovery of the ranch must be dismissed ignominiously. \"Curse\\nhim! Why did he cross my path? I am an old man, and I do not wish to\\ndistress my daughter, or I would go now to Bison and shoot him at\\nsight!\"\\n\\nSo John Darien Power had made at least one determined enemy, and it may\\nbe taken for granted that, had he visited the Dolores ranch instead of\\nDenver on that first day in the open air after his accident, no money he\\ncould command would have made him undisputed lord of the land and all it\\ncontained.\\n\\nBut evil thinking is a weed that thrives in the most unlikely soil. To\\nall appearance, with Nancy wed and the foundations of a fortune securely\\nlaid, Willard\\'s animosity could achieve small harm to Power. Yet it\\nremained vigorous throughout the years, and its roots spread far, so\\nthat when the opportunity came they entangled Power\\'s feet, and he fell,\\nand was nearly choked to death by them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nWHEREIN POWER TRAVELS EAST\\n\\n\\nOne summer\\'s day at high noon a man rode into Bison from the direction\\nof the railway, and, judging by the critical yet interested glances he\\ncast right and left while his drowsy mustang plodded through the dust,\\nhe seemed to be appraising recent developments keenly. As the horseman\\nwas Francis Willard, and as this was the first time he had visited Bison\\nsince leaving the ranch, there were many novelties to repay his\\nscrutiny. The number of houses had been nearly doubled, the store had\\nswollen proportionately, not to mention the Bison Hotel, which had\\nsprung into being on the site of the ramshackle lean-to where once\\nMacGonigal\\'s patrons had stabled their \"plugs,\" and a roomy omnibus\\nrumbled to and fro in the main street before and after the departure of\\nevery train from the depot.\\n\\nThese unerring signs of prosperity spoke volumes; but it was only when\\nthe rider drew rein near the mouth of the Gulch that he was able to note\\nthe full measure of Bison\\'s progress. Deep in a hollow to the left were\\ntwo mills instead of one, and the noise of ore-crunching rolls was\\nquadrupled in volume. Two long rows of recently erected cyanide vats\\nbetokened the increased output of the mine, and, even while Willard sat\\nthere, gazing moodily at a scene almost strange to his vision, an\\nengine snorted by, seemingly hauling a dozen loaded trucks, but in\\nreality exerting its panting energy to restrain the heavily freighted\\ncars from taking headlong charge of the downward passage. Another\\nengine, heading a similar string of empty wagons, was evidently on the\\npoint of making the ascent; so Willard jogged an unwilling pony into\\nmovement again, and entered the Gulch.\\n\\nBeyond the two sets of rails, nothing new caught his eye here until he\\nhad rounded the curve leading to the watershed. Then he came in sight of\\nthe original entrance to the mine--a shaft was being sunk nearly\\nthree-quarters of a mile away, but he was not aware of that at the\\nmoment--and noticed that a stout man, jauntily arrayed in a white canvas\\nsuit and brown boots, who had a cigar tucked into a corner of his mouth,\\nhad strolled out of a pretentious-looking office building, and was\\nobviously surprised by the appearance of a mounted man in that place at\\nthat moment.\\n\\nMacGonigal had, in fact, recognized Willard the instant he swung into\\nview, because none of the ranchers rode that way nowadays, a more\\ncircuitous but safer trail having been cut to avoid the rails.\\n\\nMac had certainly remarked that he was dog-goned when he set eyes on\\nWillard, and a similar sentiment was expressed more emphatically by the\\nvisitor; for there was no love lost between those two, and, in\\nconsequence, their greetings were unusually gracious.\\n\\n\"Wall, Mr. Willard, ef this don\\'t beat cock-fightin\\'!\" cried MacGonigal,\\nwhen the other halted at the foot of an inclined way leading to the\\nlevel space from which rock had been blasted to provide room for the\\nvarious structures that cluster near the outlet of a busy mine. \"Now,\\nwho\\'d ha thought of seein\\' you hereabouts terday?\"\\n\\n\"Or any other day, Mr. MacGonigal,\" said Willard, forcing an agreeable\\nsmile. The prefix to MacGonigal\\'s name was a concession to all that had\\ngone before during a short half-hour\\'s ride. The ex-storekeeper was now\\nthe nominal head of a gold-producing industry which ranked high in the\\nstate, and the bitterness welling up in Willard\\'s mind had been quelled\\nmomentarily by sheer astonishment.\\n\\n\"That\\'s as may be,\" returned Mac affably, rolling the cigar across his\\nmouth. \"But, seein\\' as you air on this section of the map, guess you\\'d\\nbetter bring that hoss o\\' yourn into the plaza. A bunch of cars is due\\nhere any minute.\"\\n\\nWillard jogged nearer, and dismounted, and a youth summoned by\\nMacGonigal took charge of the mustang.\\n\\n\"Hev\\' yer come ter see Power?\" inquired the stout one, with just the\\nright amount of friendly curiosity.\\n\\n\"Well, no, not exactly. I shall be glad to meet him, of course. Is he\\nsomewhere around?\"\\n\\n\"No. He went East two days sence.\"\\n\\nNow, the movements of local financial magnates are duly chronicled in\\nthe Colorado press, and MacGonigal was sure that Willard had not only\\nread the announcement of Power\\'s departure, but had timed this visit\\naccordingly. Still, that was no affair of his. Willard was here, and\\nmight stay a month if he liked, because he would have to pay for bed and\\nboard in the Bison Hotel, which MacGonigal owned.\\n\\n\"Ah, that\\'s too bad,\" said Willard, feigning an indifference he was far\\nfrom feeling. \"Still, I have no real business on hand. I happened to be\\nat a loose end in Denver, and didn\\'t seem to know anybody in the Brown\\nPalace Hotel; so I came out here, to take a peep at the old shanty, so\\nto speak.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll hev\\' located an alteration or two already?\" chuckled the other.\\n\\n\"Every yard of the way was a surprise.\"\\n\\n\"Guess that\\'s so; but what you\\'ve seen is small pertaters with the\\ncircus on the other side of the hill.\"\\n\\n\"On the ranch! Things can\\'t have changed so greatly there?\"\\n\\n\"You come this-a way, an\\' survey the park.\"\\n\\nMacGonigal led the visitor through a check office, and along a corridor.\\nThrowing open a door, he ushered him into a well furnished room, with\\ntwo French windows opening on to a spacious veranda.\\n\\n\"This yer is Derry\\'s den,\" he said. \"He likes ter look at the grass\\ngrowin\\'; but my crib is at the other side, whar I kin keep tab on the\\nstuff that makes most other things grow as well. Not that it ain\\'t dead\\neasy ter know why Derry likes this end of the outfit--an\\' nobody livin\\'\\n\\'ll understand that better\\'n yerself, Mr. Willard, when you\\'ve looked\\nthe proposition over fer ten seconds by the clock.\"\\n\\nWillard had never found MacGonigal so loquacious in former days; but he\\nwas too preoccupied by the tokens of success that met his furtive gaze\\nin every direction to give much heed to any marked change in his guide\\'s\\nmanner. Moreover, he had scarcely set foot in the veranda before he\\nyielded to a feeling which, at first, was one of undiluted amazement.\\nThe annual rainfall had been normal since he abandoned ranching; but\\nColorado in June is not exactly the home of lush meadows during the best\\nof years, and he was staring now at a fertile panorama of green\\npastures, and thriving orchards, while the ranch itself was set in the\\nmidst of smooth lawns embosomed in a wealth of shrubs and ornamental\\ntrees. Greatest miracle of all, a tiny stream of pellucid water was\\nflowing down the Gulch.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t quite grasp this,\" he muttered thickly, while his eyes roved\\nalmost wildly from the dancing rivulet to the fair savannah which it had\\nmade possible.\\n\\n\"A bit of a wonder, ain\\'t it?\" gurgled MacGonigal placidly. \"Jest\\nanother piece of luck, that\\'s what it air. Derry can\\'t go wrong, I keep\\ntellin\\' him. I had a notion the hull blamed show was busted when we\\nstruck a spring at the end o\\' the fust dip of two hundred feet; but\\nDerry jest laughed in his quiet way, an\\' said, \\'There oughter be tears\\nround about any place called Grief, an\\' now we have Dolores weepin\\'.\\nWe\\'ve tapped a perennial spring, Mac, an\\' it\\'s the very thing I wanted\\nter make the ranch a fair copy of Paradise.\\' There you hev\\' it--Derry\\'s\\nluck--a pipe line laid on by Nature--an\\' him raisin\\' apples, Mr.\\nWillard, raisin\\' pippins as big as your fist, on land whar _you_\\ncouldn\\'t raise a bundle of alfalfa!\"\\n\\nWillard had to find something to say, or he would have choked with\\nspleen. \"Evidently the inrush of water did not injure the mine?\" he\\nblurted out; but, for the life of him, he could not conceal the envy in\\nhis voice.\\n\\n\"Did good, really,\" chortled MacGonigal. \"We had to drive a new adit,\\nan\\' that cleared away enough rock ter give us elbow-room. The fust\\nintake was up thar,\" and he pointed to that part of the Gulch where\\nPower had once wrought with death on a long-vanished ledge. \"Now we go\\nin about a hundred feet west of this yer veranda, an\\' the haulin\\' is\\neasier.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Power and you have created a marvelous property here,\" said Willard\\nafter a long pause.\\n\\n\"Not me,\" said MacGonigal quickly. \"I helped Derry with my wad; but he\\ndid all the thinkin\\', an\\' it\\'s like a fresh chapter outer a fairy tale\\nwhen I wake up every fine mornin\\' an\\' remember that my third share is\\nbringin\\' me in close on five hundred dollars a day.\"\\n\\n\"So Power\\'s interest is worth three hundred thousand dollars a year?\"\\n\\n\"More\\'n that, I reckon. The output keeps on pilin\\' up, an\\' Derry\\'s\\nhorses \\'ll add a tidy bit to his bank balance this year.\"\\n\\n\"His horses?\"\\n\\n\"Yep. Hain\\'t you heerd? One-thumb Jake is manager of the plug\\ndepartment. Nigh on fifty two-year-olds \\'ll be sold this fall at two\\nhundred dollars an\\' more a throw. I suspicioned Derry was goin\\' crazy\\nwhen he bought up so many mares; but I allow he has the bulge on me now.\\nAn\\' Jake! Dang me if he didn\\'t show up at a dance t\\'other evenin\\' with a\\nsilver fringe on his chaps!\"\\n\\nWillard turned reluctantly into the darkened room, and, by some\\nmischance, when his eyes had recovered from the external glare, the\\nfirst object they dwelt on was a framed pencil sketch of the Dolores\\nhomestead as he had last seen it--a dreary, ramshackle place, arid and\\npoverty-stricken. In the corner was written, \"Nancy,\" and a date.\\n\\n\"The ways of fortune are mysterious,\" he said, making shift to utter the\\nwords calmly. \"I endured ten long years of financial loss in the house\\nwhich my daughter has shown there. She used to know Mr. Power, and gave\\nthe drawing to him, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"Derry thinks a heap of that picter,\" commented MacGonigal.\\n\\n\"I wonder why?\"\\n\\n\"He never tole me.\"\\n\\nWillard laughed disagreeably. He had not forgotten Mac\\'s peculiarities,\\none of which used to be blank ignorance concerning any subject on which\\nhe did not wish to be drawn.\\n\\n\"By the way,\" he said, \"why did you give the new mine such a queer\\nname--El Preco--I guess you know it means, \\'The Price\\'? Why was it\\ncalled that?\"\\n\\n\"It was jest a notion of Derry\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Rather odd, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Derry\\'s mostly odd, size him up anyways you hev\\' a mind ter.\"\\n\\n\"I could have understood it better had he christened the place, \\'The\\nBargain.\\' He shook me up good and hard when he grabbed Dolores for five\\nthousand dollars.\"\\n\\n\"He sure had his wits about him, had Derry,\" said MacGonigal admiringly.\\n\\n\"And he has gone now to New York, you tell me,\" went on Willard.\\n\\n\"East, I said.\"\\n\\n\"Well, East stands for New York all the time. Is he making a long stay\\nthere?\"\\n\\n\"He never said a word. Jest, \\'So long, Mack,\\' an\\', \\'So long, Derry.\\'\\nThat\\'s all thar was to it. Kin I get you a drink? Thar\\'s a chunk of ice\\nsomewhar in the outfit.\"\\n\\n\"No, thanks. Time I got a move on. How about those freight cars of\\nyours? Have I a clear road back through the Gulch?\"\\n\\n\"Thar\\'s a half-hour\\'s off spell right now,\" was the prompt answer, and a\\nminute later the resident manager of El Preco mine was watching Willard\\ndescend the canyon in the direction of Bison.\\n\\n\"I\\'d give a ten-spot ter know jest why that skunk kem nosin\\' round\\nhere,\" he mused, gazing contemplatively after the slow-moving mustang\\nand its rider. Then he called the youth who had held the horse during\\nWillard\\'s brief visit.\\n\\n\"What sort of an Indian air you, Billy?\" he grinned.\\n\\n\"Purty spry, Boss, when the trail\\'s fresh,\" said the boy.\\n\\n\"Well, hike after old man Willard, an\\' let me know when he\\'s safe off\\nthis yer section.\"\\n\\nWithin a couple of hours Billy reported that Willard had entered a train\\nbound for Denver, and MacGonigal blew a big breath of relief. It was not\\nthat he had the slightest misgiving as to the effect of Willard\\'s ill\\nwill against either his partner or himself, but he was intensely anxious\\nthat Power should not come in contact with anyone who would remind him\\nof the existence of Mrs. Hugh Marten. Power himself never mentioned her;\\nso his faithful friend and trusted associate in business could only hope\\nthat the passing years, with their multiplicity of fresh interests, were\\ngradually dimming the memory of events which had altered the whole\\ncourse of his life.\\n\\nMacGonigal did not think it necessary to tell Willard that Power had\\nbrought his mother from San Francisco soon after the mine proved its\\nworth. Mother and son occupied the Dolores ranch. The presence of the\\ngentle, white-haired woman was a positive blessing to Bison; for she\\ncontrived to divert no mean percentage of her son\\'s big income into\\nchannels of social and philanthropic effort in which she took a close\\npersonal interest. A library and reading-room had been established; a\\ntechnical instruction class offered an excellent supplement to the state\\nschool; a swimming bath was built close to the mills; two churches were\\nin course of erection; a wideawake theatrical manager at Denver had\\nsecured a site for a theater and the township already boasted its ten\\nmiles of metaled roadway. In the self-satisfied phrase of the\\ninhabitants, Bison was becoming \"quite a place,\" and everyone testified\\nthat it was to Mrs. Power rather than her son that all these civic\\nimprovements were due. Men had even ceased to consult Power himself on\\nsuch matters.\\n\\n\"You run and see my mother about that,\" he would say, with a quiet\\nsmile, when someone had endeavored to arouse his sympathy in behalf of a\\ndeserving object. \"It\\'s my affair to make the money which she spends.\\nGet her to O. K. your scheme, and it goes.\"\\n\\nIn business he was equally unapproachable.\\n\\n\"Put it before MacGonigal,\" was his regular formula. \"I can\\'t do a thing\\nwithout his say-so. But I warn you he is a terror. If there\\'s a kink in\\nyour proposition, he\\'ll find it, as sure as Jake can run his fingers\\nonto a splint.\"\\n\\nFor all that, the stout manager of mine and mill realized his\\nlimitations.\\n\\nOnce, and once only, did MacGonigal act in the belief that Power had\\nreferred a point to him for final settlement. A glib agent for mining\\nmachinery persuaded him to purchase a new type of drill, which proved\\nabsolutely useless when asked to disintegrate the hard granite of\\nColorado. Power laughed when he heard of its failure.\\n\\n\"You must have thought it was meant for cutting cheese, Mac,\" he said\\nlightly. But the barbed shaft struck home, and \"the terror\" bought no\\nmore drills without first consulting the man who understood them.\\n\\nThus, slowly but effectually, Power contrived to isolate himself from\\nBison. With an almost uncanny prescience he gave occasional directions\\nin the mine, or suggested some modification in the milling process which\\ninvariably resulted in a higher percentage of extraction. For the rest,\\nhe devoted his days to the improvement of the stud farm, and his\\nevenings to books. His mother tried vainly to dissipate this recluse\\ntrend of thought and habit. On one memorable occasion she invited a\\nfriend and her two cheerful and good-looking daughters to visit the\\nranch for a week. Timidly enough, she had sprung a surprise on her son,\\nwarning him of the forthcoming invasion only when it was too late to\\nstop travelers already en route from San Francisco. Then she, like\\nMacGonigal, had to learn her lesson. Derry agreed she had acted quite\\nrightly. He merely expressed a suave doubt that the ladies would enjoy\\nthe enforced seclusion of a place like Dolores, but they might\\nappreciate the air. Then he strolled out, and a telegram from Denver\\napologized for a sudden departure to Chicago. He explained in a letter\\nthat he was in need of a number of books, and thought it best to look\\nthrough the bookstores in person rather than trust to catalogues. He\\nreturned two days after the guests had left, and there were no more\\nexperiments in that direction. Be sure that an anxious mother had long\\nago formed a remarkably accurate opinion as to the circumstances\\nattending Nancy Willard\\'s wedding; but, being a wise woman, she said no\\nword to her son concerning it, and was content to pray that the cloud\\nmight lift from off his soul, and that he might yet meet a girl who\\nwould make him a good and loving wife. For that is the way of women who\\nare mothers--they find real joy only in the well-being of their\\noffspring. Though this gentle-hearted creature knew that she was risking\\nsome of her own belated happiness in bringing about her son\\'s marriage,\\nshe was ready to dare that, and more, for his sake. She longed to renew\\nher own youth in fondling his children. She was almost feverishly\\ndesirous of seeing him thoroughly established in a bright and cheerful\\nhome before the gathering mists shut him out forever from her sight. So\\nshe waited, and watched, and wondered what the future had in store for\\nher loved one, and often, in her musings, she tried to imagine what\\nmanner of girl Nancy Willard was that she should have inspired such an\\nenduring and hopeless passion.\\n\\nThe upheaval, when it came, was due to the simplest of causes. Power had\\nforeseen the tremendous industrial development which lay before\\nColorado, and indulged his horse-breeding hobby on lines calculated to\\nproduce a large income wholly apart from the ever-increasing profits of\\nthe mine. The state needed horses, which must be strong of bone, with\\nplenty of lung capacity; yet not too heavy, for mountain tracks and\\ndusty valleys are anathema to the soft Belgian. They must be presentable\\nanimals, too, symmetrical, of untarnished lineage, and of a type fitted\\neither for saddle or harness, because Colorado was making money in a\\nhurry. Thus, it chanced that, shortly before Willard\\'s ill-omened visit\\nto Bison, an Eastern agent wrote advising Power to attend a sale in New\\nYork. A noted breeder of hackneys, who had imported some of the best\\nsires from England and Russia, and owned several fine Percherons, was\\nbreaking up his stud, and the chance thus presented of securing some\\nmagnificent stock might not be repeated during another decade.\\n\\nPower asked his mother to accompany him; but she was afraid of the long\\njourney in the torrid temperature then obtaining. Yielding to his\\nwishes, she telegraphed a second time to her San Francisco friends, and\\nthey accepted an invitation joyously and promptly. Moreover, seeing that\\nshe was regarding with some misgivings his prospective absence from the\\nranch for a period which could not well be less than three weeks, he\\nmade a great concession.\\n\\n\"If Mrs. Moore and her girls can arrange to stay so long, keep them here\\nuntil I return,\" he said, and the pleasure in the worn, lined face fully\\nrepaid the effort those words cost him. So they kissed, and parted, and\\nthe weary years which have passed since that sunlit morning in Colorado\\nhave contained no diviner solace for the man than the knowledge that he\\nleft his mother well satisfied with her lot, and smiling a farewell\\nwithout the slightest premonition of evil or sorrow. It is well to part\\nthus from those whom we love; for no man knows what the future may have\\nin store--and horror would have been added to the burden of Power\\'s\\nsuffering if recollections of the last hours of companionship with his\\nmother were clouded by an abiding sense of unkindness or unfilial\\ntreatment.\\n\\nSo Power hied him to New York, which meant that he passed three hot\\nnights and two hotter days in a fast-speeding train. The Rock Island\\nRailroad took him across the rolling prairie to Omaha and Chicago, and,\\nin the city which no steer nor sheep nor hog can visit and live, he\\nentered the palatial Pennsylvania Limited, which, in those unregenerate\\ndays, dumped him out early in the morning on the New Jersey shore. Then,\\nfor the first time, he saw New York, and saw it from the river, which is\\nthe one way to see New York for the first time. Crossing by the ferry to\\n23d Street, he did not, it is true, secure that wondrous initial glimpse\\nof a city, unequaled, in many respects, by any other, which is\\nvouchsafed to the traveler arriving by sea. But, even twenty-two years\\nago, the busy Hudson was no mean stream, and when Power\\'s unaccustomed\\neye turned bewildered from the maze of shipping which thronged that\\nmagnificent waterway it found fresh wonders in the far-flung panorama\\nstretching from Grant\\'s Tomb to the Battery. At that time Trinity Church\\nwas still a landmark, for New York had hardly begun to climb into the\\nempyrean; so the prospect was pleasing rather than stupefying, as it is\\ntoday.\\n\\nA hot wind already hissed with furnace-breath over the fourteen miles of\\nserried streets that lined the opposite shore; for, in the long years\\nwhich have sped since Power first crossed the Hudson, New York has\\nneither lengthened nor broadened. Even mighty Gotham cannot achieve the\\nimpossible; so, in the interim, several new cities have been\\nsuperimposed on the older one which spread its beauties before his\\nbewildered vision. The _Paris_--who of the middle generation does not\\nremember the _Paris_, with her invariable list to starboard, after an\\nocean crossing?--was creeping slowly upstream, and Power was amused by\\nthe discovery that the big ship, like himself, moved with a limp. The\\n_City of Rome_, whose yacht-like lines suggested the poetry of motion,\\nbut, as is the mode on Parnassus, adhered strictly to suggestion, lay at\\nanchor near the Jersey shore, and when the ferry churned around her\\ngraceful stem, the grim walls of the Palisades completed a picture which\\nadmits of few peers. Disillusionment came later; but the spell of that\\nthrilling first impression was never wholly lost. Driving through 23d\\nStreet, on his way to the Waldorf Hotel, Power could not help comparing\\nthis important thoroughfare with Market Street, San Francisco, and State\\nStreet, Chicago, and the architectural stock of the metropolis\\nexperienced a sudden slump. Nor did it wholly recover lost points when\\nhis carriage entered Madison Square, with its newly erected campanile,\\nalmost a replica of the stately Giralda tower in Seville, its glimpses\\nof Broadway, south and north, its stolid Fifth Avenue Hotel, and its\\nchastely elegant, though still towerless, white Metropolitan building.\\nEven the Waldorf, then less than a fourth of the Waldorf-Astoria, though\\nnotable already among the public palaces of the world, failed to strike\\nhis imagination with the appeal of the Palace Hotel, San Francisco; the\\ntruth being that New York, first in the field by a couple of centuries,\\nhad not yet begun, like Milton\\'s eagle, to mew her mighty youth.\\n\\nIt would assuredly be interesting to those who knew and loved the queen\\ncity of the Atlantic nearly a quarter of a century ago if Power\\'s\\nrevised and corrected opinions might be quoted now. But the chronicle of\\na man\\'s life ought to be accurate before it is picturesque, and the\\ntruth is that the heat-wave which was then withering the whole Eastern\\nseaboard kept this visitor from breezy Colorado pent within the marble\\nhalls of the Waldorf Hotel, save when urgent need drove him forth. That\\nparticular scourge of high temperature was destined to become\\nhistorical. The thermometer soared up beyond 100 degrees Fahrenheit;\\nhundreds of people were stricken daily by heat apoplexy; the hospitals\\nwere crammed to their utmost capacity; the asphalt pavement, where it\\nexisted, showed ruts like a muddy road in the country; and it is easy to\\nunderstand why a man who had cheerfully endured 110 degrees and 115\\ndegrees in the dry heat of the nearer Rockies should gasp for air here\\nlike a fish out of water.\\n\\nWorst of all, the horse sale was postponed. The owner of the stud and\\nhis prospective patrons alike had flown to sea and mountain for relief.\\nAs inquiry showed that the horse-breeder himself had gone to Newport,\\nPower made haste to secure a stateroom on one of the Fall River line of\\nsteamboats, and it was on this quest that the _Puritan Maiden_, a vessel\\non which folk would travel merely for the sake of describing her to\\ntheir friends, brought him to the chief summer resort of fashionable\\nlife in America.\\n\\nHe had not the slightest notion that Mrs. Hugh Marten was disporting\\nherself daily on that particular stretch of Rhode Island beach. For all\\nthat he knew, she might as well have been at Trouville or Brighton.\\nIndeed, had anyone dared the lightning of his glance by mentioning her,\\nand if he were compelled to hazard a guess as to her possible\\nwhereabouts, he would certainly have said that, to the best of his\\nbelief, she was in Europe. Such was the fact; but there are facts in\\nevery life which assume the guise of sheer incredibility when analyzed,\\nsay, in the doubtful atmosphere of a law-court. In the dark days to\\ncome, during those silent watches of the night when a man looks back\\nalong the tortuous ways of the past, John Darien Power could only lift\\nimpotent hands to Heaven and plead in anguish that he might at least\\nhave been spared an ordeal which he not only did not seek, but would\\nhave fled to the uttermost parts of the earth to have avoided. Such\\nmoments of introspection were few and far between, it is true. His was\\ntoo self-contained a nature that he should rail against the Omnipotent\\nfor having tested him beyond endurance. He made a great fight, and he\\nfailed, and he paid an indemnity which is not to be measured by any\\nother scale than that alone which records the noblest effort.\\n\\nTo his own thinking, the tragedy of his life began that day in Bison\\nwhen the sympathetic storekeeper told him of Nancy Willard\\'s marriage.\\nBut he was wrong in that belief. A man may lose the woman he loves, and\\nrecover from the blow, but he peers into abysmal depths when he meets\\nher as another man\\'s wife, and finds that love, though sorely wounded,\\nis not dead. It is then that certain major fiends, unknown to the\\ngenerality, come forth from their lairs--and there must have been a rare\\nawakening of crafty ghouls on the day Power reached Newport.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nTHE MEETING\\n\\n\\nWhen Power arrived at New England\\'s chief summer resort on a glorious\\nJuly morning twenty-two years ago, man had succeeded in adding only a\\ngarish fringe to a quietly beautiful robe devised by Nature. Some few\\npretentious houses had been built; but local residences in the mass made\\nup an architectural hotch-potch utterly at variance with sylvan\\nsolitudes and breezy cliffs. Rhode Island, which lends its name to the\\nentire state, is slightly larger than Manhattan. A long southwesterly\\nspur shields from the mighty rages of the Atlantic the little bay on\\nwhich the old town of Newport stands; but the climate has the bracing\\nfreshness which is almost invariably associated with the northern half\\nof that great ocean. If the bare rudiments of artistry existed among the\\nidle rich who overran the island during the \\'80\\'s, it should have\\nprotected a charming blend of seashore and grassy downs from the Italian\\npalaces, Rhenish castles, Swiss chalets, and don-jon keeps which the\\nfreakish conceits of plutocrats placed cheek by jowl along the coast.\\nNowadays these excrescences are either swallowed in forests of well\\ngrown trees or have become so beautified by creepers that they have lost\\nmuch of their bizarre effect; while magnificent avenues, carefully laid\\nout and well shaded, run through a new city of delightful villas and\\nresplendent gardens. But Power\\'s first stroll from the portals of the\\nOcean House revealed a medley in which bad taste ran riot. The Casino, a\\nmiserable-looking structure, was saved from dismal mediocrity by its\\nsplendid lawns alone; the surf-bathers\\' friends were protected from the\\nfierce sun by a long, low shanty built of rough planks; the roads were\\nunkempt, and ankle-deep in mud or dust; broken-down shacks alternated\\nwith mansions; a white marble replica of some old Florentine house,\\nstuck bleakly on one knob of a promontory, was scowled at by a\\nheavy-jowled fortress cumbering its neighbor.\\n\\nHe found these things irritating. They were less in harmony with their\\nenvironment than the corrugated iron roofs of Bison. His gorge rose at\\nthem. They satisfied no esthetic sense. In a word, he resolved to get\\nthrough his business with the horse-fancying judge as speedily as might\\nbe, and escape to the unspoiled wilderness of Maine.\\n\\nWere it not for one of those minor accidents which at times can exert\\nsuch irresistible influence on the course of future events, he would\\ncertainly have left Newport without ever being aware of Mrs. Marten\\'s\\npresence there. He ascertained that the judge had gone off early in the\\nmorning on a yachting excursion up Narragansett Bay, having arranged to\\nlunch at a friend\\'s house at Pawtucket; so, perforce, he had to wait in\\nNewport another day.\\n\\nAt dinner he was allotted a seat at a large round table reserved for\\nunattached males like himself. The company was a curiously mixed one,\\nbut pleasant withal. A Norwegian from San Francisco, who sold Japanese\\ncurios, a globe-trotting Briton, a Southerner from Alabama, a man from\\nPlainville, New Jersey, and a Mexican who spoke no English, made up,\\nwith Power himself, a genuinely cosmopolitan board, and Power soon\\ndiscovered that he was the only person present who could understand the\\nMexican. Mere politeness insisted that he should lend his aid as\\ninterpreter when a <DW64> waiter asked the olive-skinned senor what he\\nwould like to eat; but the \"Greaser,\" as he was dubbed instantly, proved\\nto be a jovial soul, who laughed when any of the other men laughed,\\ninsisted on having the joke translated, and roared again when it was\\nexplained to him, so that each quip earned a double recognition, while\\nhe never failed to pay his own score by some joyous anecdote or amusing\\nrepartee. Thus, Power was forced into the role of \"good fellow\" in a way\\nwhich he would not have believed possible a few hours earlier. In spite\\nof himself, the merry mood of other years came uppermost, and, when the\\nparty broke up at midnight, after a long and lively sitting on a moonlit\\nveranda, he retired to his room with a certain feeling of marvel and\\nagreeable surprise at the change which one evening of enforced\\nrelaxation had effected in his outlook on life. He decided that these\\nchance companions had done him a world of good, that his misanthropic\\nattitude was a false one, and that a week or two at Newport might send\\nhim back to Colorado a better man. Applying to a state of mind a\\nmetaphor drawn from material things, he felt as an Englishman feels who\\nleaves his own dripping and fog-bound island on a January afternoon and\\nwakes next morning amid the roses and sunshine of the Riviera. The\\nglitter on land and sea may bear a close resemblance to spangles and\\ngilt paper on the stage; but it is cheering to eyes which have not seen\\nthe sun for weeks, and when, in such conditions, John Bull sits down to\\nluncheon under the awnings of a cafe facing the blue Mediterranean, he\\nis unquestionably quite a different being from the muffled-up person who\\nhurried on board the steamer at Dover.\\n\\nPower had contrived to withdraw himself so completely from the more\\ngenial side of existence at Bison that he rediscovered it with a fresh\\nzest. Next day he was no longer alone. The man from Birmingham, Alabama,\\nand the Englishman shared his love of horses, and the three visited the\\njudge, who stabled some of his cattle on the island, and had photographs\\nand pedigrees galore wherewith to describe the stock on his New York\\nfarm.\\n\\nSo Power stayed two days, and yet a third, and he was laughing with the\\nrest at some quaint bit of Spanish humor which he had translated for the\\nbenefit of the company at dinner on the third evening, when he became\\naware that a lady, entering with a large party, for whose use a table\\nhad been specially decorated, was standing stock-still and looking at\\nhim. He lifted his eyes, and met the astonished gaze of Mrs. Marten.\\n\\n\"Derry!\" she gasped.\\n\\n\"Nancy!\" said he, wholly off his guard, and flushing violently in an\\nabsurd consciousness of having committed some fault. She had caught him,\\nas it were, in a boisterous moment utterly at variance with the three\\nyears of self-imposed monasticism which followed her marriage. Yet, with\\nthe speed of thought, he saw the futility of such reasoning. The\\ngirl-wife knew nothing of his sufferings. She was greeting him with all\\nthe warmth of undiminished friendship, and could not possibly understand\\nthat he had endured tortures for her sake. So he regained his wits\\nalmost at once, and was on his feet, bowing.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Marten,\" he went on. \"Your presence here took\\nme completely unawares. You are the last person breathing I expected to\\nsee in Newport.\"\\n\\nShe laughed delightedly, with no hint of flurry or confusion beyond that\\nfirst natural outburst.\\n\\n\"It would sound much nicer if you said what I am going to say to you,\"\\nshe cried, \"that you are one of the few persons breathing whom I am\\nreally delighted to see in Newport. But I can\\'t stop and talk now. I\\'ll\\nask Mrs. Van Ralten to forgive me if I slip away from her party for ten\\nminutes after dinner. Mind, you wait for me on the veranda. I\\'m simply\\ndying to hear some news of dear old Bison! How is Mac? Oh, my! I really\\nmust go. But don\\'t you dare escape afterward!\"\\n\\nForgetful of all else, he allowed his startled eyes to follow her as she\\nran to her place at the neighboring table. She was dressed in some\\nconfection of white tulle and silver; a circlet of diamonds sparkled in\\nher thick brown hair; a big ruby formed a clasp in front for an aigrette\\nof osprey plumes; her robes and bearing were those of a princess. Were\\nit not for the warranty of his senses, he would never have pictured the\\ngirl of the Dolores ranch in this fine lady. Even now he stood as one in\\na trance, half incredulous of the evidence of eyes and ears, and\\nseemingly afraid lest he might awake and come back to the commonplaces\\nof an existence in which the Nancy Willard of his dreams had no part.\\n\\nThe Englishman, Dacre by name, knew something of the world and its\\ndenizens, and he had seen the blood rush to his friend\\'s face and ebb\\naway again until the brown skin was sallow.\\n\\n\"Sit down, old chap,\" he said quietly. \"I was just thinking of ordering\\nsome wine for the public benefit. Do you drink fizz?\"\\n\\nThe calm voice helped to restore Power\\'s bemused senses. Afraid lest his\\nmoonstruck attitude might have been observed by some of Mrs. Marten\\'s\\ncompanions, he tried to cover his confusion by a jest.\\n\\n\"Wine, did you say?\" he cried. \"Certainly--let\\'s have a magnum. Bottled\\nsunlight should help to dissipate visions.\"\\n\\n\"Anacreon has something to that effect in one of his odes; though he\\nvowed that he worshiped Wine, Woman, and the Muses in equal measure.\"\\n\\n\"Who is Anacreon?\" asked the man from Plainville.\\n\\n\"He flourished at Athens about 600 B.C.,\" laughed Dacre.\\n\\n\"Did he? By gosh! The Greeks knew a bit, then, even at that time.\"\\n\\n\"This one in particular was an authority on those three topics. Love, to\\nhim, was no mischievous boy armed with silver darts, but a giant who\\nstruck with a smith\\'s hammer. He died like a gentleman, too, being\\nchoked by a grapestone at the age of eighty-five.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that explains it!\"\\n\\n\"Explains what?\"\\n\\n\"He had a small swallow, or rum and romance would have knocked him out\\nin half the time.\"\\n\\nPower was rapidly becoming himself again. \"I behaved like a stupid boy\\njust now,\" he said; \"but I was never more taken aback in my life. I have\\nnot met Mrs. Marten since her marriage, three years ago, and I imagined\\nshe was in Europe.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, is that Mrs. Marten?\" chimed in downright Plainville. \"Last\\nSunday\\'s papers whooped her up as the prize beauty of Newport this\\nsummer, and I guess they got nearer the truth than usual. She\\'s a sure\\nwinner.\"\\n\\n\"Did I hear her mention Mrs. Van Ralten?\" inquired Dacre.\\n\\n\"Yes, her hostess tonight, I believe.\"\\n\\n\"Van Ralten and Marten hurried off together to the Caspian last week.\\nThey are interested in the oil wells at Baku.\"\\n\\nCymbals seemed to clash in Power\\'s brain, and he heard his own voice\\nsaying in a subdued and colorless staccato, \"I am sorry I did not meet\\nher sooner. I leave tomorrow.\"\\n\\nDacre looked at him curiously; but the wine had arrived, a choice\\nvintage of the middle \\'70\\'s, and the Mexican was lifting his glass.\\n\\n\"_El sabio muda conseja; el necio no_,\" he quoted.\\n\\nThe phrase was so apt that Power glanced at the speaker with marked\\ndoubt; whereupon the blond Norwegian asked what the senor had said.\\n\\n\"He told us that the wise man changes his mind, but the fool does not,\"\\ntranslated Power.\\n\\n\"Gee whizz!\" cried Plainville. \"It\\'s a pity he can\\'t give out the text\\nin good American; for he talks horse sense most all the time. If _I_ had\\na peach like Mrs. Marten callin\\' me \\'Derry,\\' damn if I\\'d quit for a\\nmonth!\"\\n\\nThe general laugh at this dry comment evoked a demand by the Mexican for\\na Spanish version of the joke. Then he made it clear that he had\\nresolved to abjure wine, and was only salving his conscience by a\\nproverb.\\n\\nThis cheerful badinage, which might pass among any gathering of men when\\none of them happened to be greeted by a pretty woman, did not leave\\nPower unscathed. He had dwelt too long apart from his fellows not to\\nwince at allusions which would glance harmlessly off less sensitive\\nskins. The iron which had entered into his soul was fused to a white\\nheat by sight of the woman he had loved and lost. He resented what he\\nimagined as being the knowledge these boon companions boasted of his\\nparlous state. Unable to join in their banter, not daring to trust his\\nvoice in the most obvious of retorts, for the man from Plainville had\\nnot been designed by nature to pose as a squire of dames, he gulped down\\na glass of champagne at a draft, and pretended to make up for wasted\\ntime in an interrupted course.\\n\\nDacre seemed to think that he would be interested in the latest gossip\\nin financial circles with reference to a supposed scheme organized by\\nMarten and Van Ralten to fight the Oil Trust. Power listened in silence\\nuntil he felt sure of himself; then he launched out vigorously.\\n\\n\"It strikes me that America has lost the art of producing great men,\" he\\nsaid. \"We whites are degenerating into mere money-grubbers; so, by the\\nlaw of compensation, our next demigod should be a <DW65>.\"\\n\\n\"Huh!\" snorted Alabama, eager for battle.\\n\\n\"That\\'s my serious opinion,\" continued Power dogmatically. \"And, what\\'s\\nmore, I think I know the <DW65>. Have any of you dined in the Auditorium\\nHotel, Chicago?\"\\n\\nYes, several; dining-room on top floor; lightning elevator; all right\\ngoing up empty, but coming down full was rather a trial.\\n\\n\"Well, you will remember that, as you go in, a young <DW52> gentleman\\ntakes your hat and overcoat, and cane or umbrella. He supplies no\\nnumbered voucher, and cannot possibly tell at which tables some six or\\nseven hundred diners will be seated. At this time of year every man is\\nwearing a straw hat of similar design; yet, as each guest comes forth,\\nhe is handed his own hat and other belongings. Now, I hold that that\\n<DW65> has a brain of supreme mathematical excellence. There is not a\\nfinancier in Wall Street who could begin to emulate that feat of memory.\\nGiven a chance, and such men make their own opportunities. The\\nAuditorium cloakroom attendant will rise to a dizzy height.\"\\n\\n\"Tosh!\" exclaimed Alabama, primed with facts to prove that hundreds of\\n<DW64>s could perform similar tricks, but were no good for anything\\nelse.\\n\\nHe was no match for Power in an argument where figures held a place,\\nand Dacre was the only other man present who realized that the talk had\\nbeen boldly and skilfully wrenched to an impersonal topic. He, at any\\nrate, made no further allusion to Marten or his projects; though he\\ncontinued to watch Power narrowly but unobtrusively. Himself something\\nof a derelict, though his aimless path lay in summer seas, he had\\nconceived a warm regard for the quiet-mannered stranger from Colorado.\\nNeither he nor any of the others knew aught of Power\\'s history, who\\nmight really be the rancher he professed to be, though his student\\'s\\nfeatures and reserved manner did not bear out the assumption. Later,\\nwhen Dacre was better informed, he realized the cause of his first\\nskepticism, for the engineer belonged to one of those rarer types of\\nmankind who, like the lawyer, the soldier, the physician, and the\\nclergyman, had the seal of his life\\'s work stamped plainly upon him.\\n\\nHence, it followed that in a spirit of sheer comradeship and sympathy he\\nkept an eye on Power during the next few days. He saw how matters were\\ntending, and risked a rebuff in offering a friendly hint when disaster\\nwas imminent. Above all--whether for good or evil who can judge? at any\\nrate, the writer of this record of a man\\'s life feels least qualified to\\ndecide the point--he brought a dominating influence to bear at a moment\\nwhen Power was adrift in a maelstrom which threatened to engulf him.\\n\\nYet there was slight sign of impending tempest in that bright room with\\nits groups of diners seemingly well content with their surroundings.\\nFrom the adjoining table, which Power could not see owing to the\\nposition he occupied, came gusts of animated conversation. Mrs. Van\\nRalten rejoiced in the loud, penetrating accents of the Middle West, and\\nsnatches of her talk were audible.\\n\\n\"I do think James Gordon might have provided a more stylish Casino while\\nhe was about it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I sail on the _Teutonic_ first week in August. Nothing will keep\\nWillie away from the moors on the Twelfth.\"\\n\\n\"Did I see them? My dear, who could miss them? Has anyone ever met such\\nfreaks outside a dime museum?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Nancy, I don\\'t wonder a little bit that you were such a success in\\nParis. The nice things I was told about you turned me green with envy.\"\\n\\nAlabama hotly contested each milestone of the Mason and Dixon Line; but\\nDacre believed that Power was less intent on the color problem than on\\ncatching each syllable of a sweet voice seldom heard above the clatter\\nof tongues at the next table. At last the meal was ended, and the men\\nstrolled out into the veranda. Mrs. Marten seemed to know when her\\nfriend had risen; she turned and waved a hand, and obviously explained\\nher action in the next breath. Soon she appeared, a radiant being fully\\nin keeping with moonlight and a garden of exotics.\\n\\n\"Mary Van Ralten is a duck,\" she said joyously, when Power hurried\\nforward. \"She has given me half an hour; but I mustn\\'t be a minute\\nlater, as she has turned out of her own house to accommodate the\\nBarnstormers from Boston, who are acting for her guests tonight. All\\nNewport will be there. You are coming, Derry. I asked her, and will\\nintroduce you afterward. My carriage will wait. But, gracious me, why\\nare you lame?\"\\n\\nHe was leading her to a couple of reserved chairs in a palm-shaded nook,\\nand she noticed that he walked with a limp.\\n\\n\"Happened an accident near the mine quite a time since,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I never heard. I wonder my father didn\\'t mention it. Anyhow, Derry, why\\nhave you never written?\"\\n\\n\"Listen to the pot calling the kettle, or, if that is only a trite\\nsimile, listen to the Fairy Queen berating a poor mortal for her own\\nlapses!\"\\n\\n\"Ah, I have not written since my marriage, it is true, but you treated\\nmy hapless missives so cavalierly when I did send them that I hardly\\ndared risk another rebuff.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked thickly. He was priding himself on the ease\\nwith which they were establishing new relations, when this unlooked-for\\ndevelopment plunged him again into a swift-running current of doubt and\\nforeboding. They were seated now, not side by side as he had planned,\\nbut in such wise that Nancy could see his face clearly, she having\\ndeliberately pulled her chair round for that purpose.\\n\\n\"Exactly what I have said,\" she answered composedly. \"I sent three\\nseparate letters to Mr. John Darien Power, the Esperanza Placer Mine,\\nSacramento--I sha\\'n\\'t forget the address in a hurry, because I\\'ve always\\nlonged to ask why you were so ready to desert a friend--and, seeing that\\nnot one of them was returned by the postoffice, I had good reason to\\nsuppose that they reached you all right. Derry, don\\'t tell me you never\\ngot them!\"\\n\\nHis heart seemed to miss a beat or two. In an instant he guessed the\\ntruth, that their correspondence had been burked by malicious\\ncontriving; but all he could find to say was:\\n\\n\"Did you really write to me?\"\\n\\n\"Of course, I did. Am I not telling you? And you, Derry, did _you_ write\\nto _me_?\"\\n\\nHis tongue almost cleaved to the roof of his mouth; for he knew, in that\\ninstant, that they were not seated in the comfortable veranda of the\\nOcean House, but standing side by side on the lip of an abyss.\\n\\nHe must not, he dared not, answer truly. He had no right to make wreck\\nand ruin of this bright young life, and none knew so well as he how\\nproudly she would denounce the thievish wiles which had separated them\\nif once she grasped their full import.\\n\\n\"It is so long ago,\" he muttered brokenly. \"So many things have occurred\\nsince. I have forgotten. I--I can only be sure that I received no\\nletters from you.\"\\n\\n\"You have forgotten!\" she repeated slowly.\\n\\n\"Yes--that is, I suffered a good deal from a broken leg--it was badly\\nset--that is why I have such a noticeable hobble. Events round about\\nthat period are all jumbled up in my mind.\"\\n\\nThe explanation was lame as his leg. It would never have deceived even\\nthe Nancy Willard of bygone years, and was utterly thrown away on this\\nwide-eyed woman. She was conscious of a fierce pain somewhere in the\\nregion of her heart, and wanted to cry aloud in her distress; but she\\ncrushed the impulse with a self-restraint that had become second nature,\\nand bent nearer, smiling wanly.\\n\\n\"Why did you throw away your cigar, Derry?\" she said. \"Please smoke.\\nLike every other man, you will talk more easily then. And do tell me\\nwhat has been going on at Bison. I have often asked Hugh for news; but\\nhe says he never hears a word about the place since he sold his\\ninterests there.\"\\n\\nPower hardly realized how swiftly and certainly she had made smooth the\\nway. He was conscious only of a vast relief that the subject of the\\nmissing correspondence was dropped. Only in later hours of quiet\\nreflection did he grasp the reason--that she was bitterly aware of the\\ntruth, and the whole truth. He began at once to describe developments on\\nthe ranch, and was too wishful to hide his own confusion behind the\\nsmoke of a cigar to notice how a white-gloved hand clenched the arm of a\\nchair when he spoke of his mother and the place she filled in public\\nesteem. Unconsciously he was telling Nancy just what she wanted to know.\\nHe was not married. There was no other woman! She uttered no sound; but\\nher lower lip bore a series of white marks for a little while.\\n\\n\"You see,\" he explained glibly, \"I acquired the habit of letting other\\npeople work when I was laid by for repairs. Please excuse these frequent\\nreferences to a broken limb, which seems to figure in my talk much as\\nKing Charles\\'s head in Mr. Dick\\'s disjointed manuscripts. Anyhow, I had\\nplenty of time for reading, as the mine paid from the very beginning,\\nand a rock spring which nearly scared Mac stiff came in handy to\\nirrigate the upper part of the ranch--that long <DW72> just below the\\nGulch, you remember.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I remember,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Well, what between fruit-growing and horse-breeding, I hardly ever have\\ntime to go near Bison. My mother drives in every day over the new\\ntrail----\"\\n\\n\"What new trail?\"\\n\\n\"We had to cut a road across the divide. The Gulch is blocked by rails.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"That is where the mine is, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. Whereabouts exactly is the mine?\"\\n\\n\"It starts in the west side of the canyon, about a hundred yards from\\nthe ranch end.\"\\n\\n\"Near a narrow cleft, topped by a sloping ledge?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. How well you recollect every yard of the ground!\"\\n\\n\"How did you come to locate the lost seam there?\"\\n\\n\"By sheer chance. Some pieces of the granite wall fell away, and any\\nminer who had been a week at his trade would have recognized the vein\\nthen.\"\\n\\n\"When did they fall away--the bits of rock, I mean?\"\\n\\n\"It must have been about the time you--you were married, Mrs. Marten.\"\\n\\nShe tapped a satin-shod foot emphatically on the boarded floor. \"Why are\\nyou calling me \\'Mrs. Marten\\'?\" she demanded.\\n\\n\"Well----\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it again. I am \\'Nancy\\' to you, Derry. I refuse to part with\\nthe privileges of friendship in that casual way. But I want to\\nunderstand things more closely. What caused the stones to fall?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mind telling,\" he said, \"though a good many people have asked\\nme the history of El Preco, and I have refused hitherto to gratify their\\ncuriosity----\"\\n\\n\"El Preco--doesn\\'t that mean \\'the price\\'?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"What an extraordinary name! The price of what?\"\\n\\n\"Of my broken leg. There, you see! King Charles\\'s head once more.\"\\n\\nShe paused, ever so briefly, before resuming her questioning. \"Now, why\\ndid the stones fall?\"\\n\\n\"Because an excited cowboy fired his revolver in the air, and the\\nbullets struck a section of rock which required some such shock to\\ndislodge it.\"\\n\\n\"But how did that affect you?\"\\n\\n\"I happened to be lying on the very ledge you spoke of, and--oh, dash it\\nall! I secured my limp then and there.\"\\n\\n\"Did the fall disturb a rattlesnake?\"\\n\\n\"It may have disturbed a dozen rattlesnakes, for all that I can tell.\\nBut what an extraordinary thing to say! Did you know that a rattler\\nlived in that cleft?\"\\n\\n\"No. I was just thinking of the Gulch and its inhabitants. Perhaps my\\nwits were wandering.... Come, Derry. Our half-hour is not gone, but we\\ncan talk on the way. Send a boy for my carriage. Do you want your hat\\nand coat?\"\\n\\nShe rose suddenly, and drew a light wrap of silvery tissue around her\\nshoulders. Power stood up, and faced her. He had never seen her looking\\nso ethereally beautiful, not even on the night, now so long ago, when he\\nparted from her before taking that disastrous journey to Sacramento.\\n\\n\"Do you really think I ought to come with you to Mrs. Van Ralten\\'s?\" he\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"Of course. Why not? You are invited.\"\\n\\n\"But----\"\\n\\n\"You are my big brother from Bison, Derry, and I\\'m not going to forgo\\nthe pleasure of your company if all Newport lined the road and bawled,\\n\\'Send him away!\\' But do hurry. Mary Van Ralten will forgive everything\\nexcept unpunctuality.\"\\n\\nThe nebulous protest on Power\\'s lips faded into silence. \"On such a\\nnight I can dispense with hat and overcoat,\" he said. \"Your carriage is\\na closed landau, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. After the play you can escort me to the Breakers--that is the name\\nof the house we have rented--and Sam, our coachman, will take you\\nhome.... Oh, there he is, waiting. Mrs. Van Ralten\\'s, Sam.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Ma\\'am,\" said the <DW64>, who had brought a carriage and pair to the\\ndoorway when he caught sight of his mistress. A <DW64> footman opened the\\ndoor, and Nancy entered, the brilliant moonlight gleaming for an instant\\non the sheen of a white silk stocking. Power seated himself by her side,\\nand the horses dashed off. He felt the soft folds of her dress touching\\nhim. When she turned slightly to say something about the marvelous\\nnights which tempered the heat-wave at Newport, her right shoulder and\\nelbow pressed him closely. Some subtle fragrance came from her that\\nstirred him almost to a frenzy of longing; yet he dared not flinch away\\ninto a corner of the carriage. Perforce, he schooled his voice to utter\\nthe platitudes of the moment. Yes, he had been in Newport three whole\\ndays, and had not the remotest notion that she was there. He had come to\\nbuy horses, and might remain another week. Well, he _would_ remain, now\\nthat they had met; for he was sure he would find a good deal to tell her\\nof Bison and its folk once he had got over the novelty and\\nunexpectedness of this meeting.\\n\\nAnd all the time his heart was pounding madly, throbbing so furiously\\nthat he feared lest she should become aware of its lack of restraint,\\nand he stooped forward in a make-believe glance at some building they\\nwere passing.\\n\\n\"That is the Casino,\" she said, misinterpreting his action, or\\npretending to--Heaven alone knows the extent of a woman\\'s divination\\nwhere a man is concerned! \"We play tennis there, in the evenings, when\\nit\\'s so hot during the day. Are you a tennis-player, Derry?... Oh, I\\'m\\nsorry! I quite forgot.\"\\n\\n\"I have been arousing your sympathy by false pretense,\" he said, and the\\nlaughter in his voice demanded a real effort. \"I can walk and ride and\\njump and dance as well as ever, and I have taught three of the ranchmen\\nto play tennis quite creditably. So, if the Newport stores run to\\nflannels and rubber shoes----\"\\n\\n\"Derry,\" she cooed, \"you are not such a fraudulent person as you\\nimagine. If you knew how much you have told me tonight about yourself,\\nyou would be awfully surprised, as they say in London. But here we are\\nat Mrs. Van Ralten\\'s. Now, be nice to everybody; for I mean you to have\\na real good time in Newport. People here can be very pleasant\\nacquaintances if you take them the right way.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nTHE FORTY STEPS\\n\\n\\nDuring the next few days Power passed imperceptibly through many phases\\nof thought and emotion. When his judgment regained its natural equipoise\\nafter the first bitter-sweet intoxication of finding his old sweetheart\\ndesirous as ever of his companionship, he appeared to subside into a\\nstate of placid acceptance of such restricted blessings as the gods\\ncould offer. Nancy made good her promise, and Newport society threw wide\\nits doors to the good-looking and well-mannered visitor. No doubts were\\nraised concerning his financial or social status. A word from the\\nhorse-fancying judge made it clear that the Westerner could not be a\\npoor man, seeing that he had already bought at stiff prices a\\nmagnificent hunter and the best-matched pair of hackneys in the States,\\nand was in treaty for another round dozen of valuable animals; while\\nMrs. Hugh Marten\\'s manifest approval was sufficient to introduce any\\nsimilarly favored young man to the most exclusive circle in the island.\\n\\nSeeing that certain things were essential, Power spent money freely,\\nsupplying himself with a dog-cart, a groom, a valet, and the rest of the\\nequipment which any man needed who would mix in that fashionable crowd\\nwithout attracting attention by lack of it. Each morning he and Nancy,\\nsometimes unaccompanied, but more often mingling with a lively party,\\nrode about the island, following rough tracks which are smooth roads\\nnowadays, and visiting every favorite stretch of cliff and open country\\ntime and again. When the weather moderated its torrid rigor, and sports\\nbecame possible in the grounds of the Casino or within the Polo Club\\'s\\ninclosure, he bore his full share. In all that pertained to horsemanship\\nhe was the equal of any man in Newport, and Nancy had not lost that\\nperfect confidence in the saddle which life on a ranch demands. Someone\\ngave prizes for a drag hunt, a hunting crop for the first man and a\\nsilver cup for the first woman in at the finish of a ten-miles\\' trail,\\nand the two came in side by side, a furlong ahead of their closest\\nfollower. Luncheons, yachting parties, dinners, musicales, and dances\\ncrowded each day and often went far into the night. The heat-wave had\\nput forward the almanac, and the Newport season was in full swing nearly\\na month in advance of its usual date.\\n\\nPower retained his rooms at the Ocean House; but saw little of other\\ninmates of the hotel unless they happened to mix in the same set. His\\nfriends of the dinner-table, except Dacre, had gone, and the Englishman,\\nlike Power, was made an honorary member of the Casino Club; so they kept\\nup and developed an acquaintance which had begun so pleasantly.\\n\\nThe close intimacy between Mrs. Marten and the stranger from Colorado\\nattracted slight comment. No breath of scandal fluttered the dovecotes\\nof Newport. The behavior of the pair was exemplary, and, beyond the\\naccepted fact that, if any hostess desired the presence of one she must\\ninvite the other, gossip about them was noticeable by its absence.\\nTheir mutual use of Christian names from the outset established a tacit\\ncousinship, and the only growl uttered behind their backs was an\\noccasional complaint from some anxious mother who found her attractive\\ndaughters completely eclipsed, in the eyes of at least one eligible\\nyoung man, by the millionaire\\'s wife.\\n\\nOnce, and once only, before the crash came, did Nancy allude to the\\npurloined letters. She and Power were riding along the Cliff Walk before\\nbreakfast, when she broached the subject quite unexpectedly.\\n\\n\"Derry, I want to ask you something,\" she said seriously. \"Did my father\\nand you ever quarrel without my knowledge--before I left Bison, I mean?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be stupid! I hate answers in monosyllables. When you say no like\\nthat, one suspects that it may really be a kind of yes.\"\\n\\n\"Then let me make it the most definite sort of negative. Remember, you\\nfixed a period. The last time I spoke to Mr. Willard before I\\nwas--before I went to Sacramento--I had supper at the ranch.\"\\n\\nHe carried reminiscence no farther. She stole a look at him; but his\\neyes were fixed on a faint blur of smoke rising over the azure plain of\\nthe Atlantic from an invisible steamship. On that unforgetable night of\\nthree and a half years ago, a starlit night of spring, she had walked\\nwith him to the mouth of the Gulch, and in bidding each other farewell\\nthey had exchanged their first and last kiss.\\n\\n\"Father was certainly not an enemy of yours then,\" she went on, in a\\nsingularly even tone. Indeed, she might have been debating a matter of\\nutmost triviality. \"It seemed to me that he always welcomed you at the\\nranch. Why did he become so bitterly opposed to you afterward?\"\\n\\nHe could have fenced with her, but deemed it preferable to speak freely.\\n\"I think he was annoyed by my rapid success,\" he said. \"He had made a\\nfailure of things generally, and I candidly admit it must have been\\nexasperating to see a youngster like me, and a steady-going fossil like\\nMac, step in and secure a fortune out of a place where he had met with\\nnothing but ill-luck. Those who get rich quick often incur animosity in\\nthat way.\"\\n\\nFor a brief space there was silence. They seemed to be listening to the\\nslumberous plash of the breakers on the rocks far below, which, with the\\npleasant creaking of saddlery, and the hoofbeats and deep breathing of\\neager horses held in restraint, were the only sounds audible in that\\nwondrous solitude. They were passing a part of the cliff known as the\\nForty Steps, a euphonious name describing a series of railed staircases,\\ncut in the solid rock, which afforded an irregular if safe passage to\\nthe beach. Ochre Point, with its millionaire residences, lay a mile, or\\nless, in front, and on their left was the illimitable ocean. After a\\nbath and breakfast they had promised to join a large party on a steam\\nyacht bound for Narragansett Pier, when luncheon and a picnic at a\\nlighthouse would fill the afternoon. This day was precisely similar to\\nany other day of a whole fortnight in its round of amusements. The\\nweather was nearly perfection, and distinctly unsuited for a\\nheart-searching discussion; but Nancy seemed to be in a mood that\\neither invited self-torture or wished to witness the writhings of her\\ncompanion, because she would not leave a difficult subject alone.\\n\\n\"Supposing, Derry,\" she continued, \"supposing I hadn\\'t got married when\\nI did, do you think you would have discovered the mine just the same?\"\\n\\nNow he was compelled to go off at a tangent. \"You resemble the majority\\nof your sex in your desire to raise non-existent bogies for the mere\\npleasure of slaying them,\" he began.\\n\\n\"Which is the bogy--my supposition or the mine?\" she broke in.\\n\\n\"How can I imagine what would have happened in circumstances which did\\nnot take place? The discovery, or rediscovery, of the mine was one of\\nthose extraordinary bits of good luck which Fortune sometimes thrusts\\nupon her favorites. It might have occurred if you had never left Bison;\\nbut, on the other hand, it might not.\"\\n\\nShe nodded her complete agreement. By not answering he had answered\\nfully.\\n\\n\"Yes, the goddess was certainly kind to you,\" she said. \"The cowboys did\\nnot often ride through the Gulch firing their revolvers. In fact, the\\nonly time I can recall any such riotous proceeding was on the day of my\\nwedding. That must have been your lucky day.\"\\n\\nShe watched him closely; but his face showed no sign of emotion. Yet she\\nwas sure that his eyes narrowed somewhat as they continued to search the\\nhorizon, and his lips were set with a dourness hardly warranted by an\\nenjoyable ride on a carefree morning.\\n\\nThen she smiled, very slightly, as though she was well pleased. She was\\nnot cruel; but any woman who wants to assure herself that a man loves\\nher will understand why Nancy Marten was putting Power on the rack, and\\neven tightening the cords almost beyond endurance.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry if I have worried you, Derry,\" she said, with a tender caress\\nin her voice that in no wise helped to mitigate his suffering. \"One more\\nquestion, and I have done. Have you told your mother that I am here?\"\\n\\nThere was no help for it. He lied boldly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said.\\n\\n\"What did she say?\"\\n\\n\"I am expecting her reply any hour.\"\\n\\n\"And Mac? Did you give him my love?\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t written to Mac since I came to Newport; but I shall not omit\\na word of your message when I see him, or write, whichever comes\\nfirst.... Have you any idea what time it is?\"\\n\\n\"Time these lazy gees were stirring themselves. Come, Hector!\"\\n\\nShe shook the reins on her horse\\'s neck, and the big hunter jumped off\\nin a fast canter. Power raced alongside, and the two struck into a\\nbyroad leading to Bellevue Avenue. Power was busying his brain to\\nformulate some colorless phrase which would supply a natural-sounding\\ncomment by his mother on the fact that he had encountered an old friend\\nin Newport. He knew well that he dared not tell her; for the tidings\\nwould distress her immeasurably. But he need not have troubled himself.\\nNancy never mentioned the matter again, for the very convincing reason\\nthat she did not believe him. Her allusion to Mrs. Power was one last\\nturn of the screw. She was as certain that he could no more explain her\\npresence to his mother than she could explain his to her father. Twice\\nhad she written his name in letters to Denver, and twice had she\\ndestroyed the letter. On the night she met Power she had dashed off a\\nhot and impetuous note asking Willard why Derry\\'s letters had been\\nwithheld; but, in calmer mood, this dangerous query was given to the\\nflames. On a second occasion, about a week later, Power\\'s name crept\\ninadvertently into a description of some incident at the Casino, and the\\nwarm blood rushed to her face and neck when she found how near she was\\nto committing the letter to the post without having read it.\\n\\nAll that day Power was puzzled by a new serenity shining in Nancy\\'s\\neyes. He could not guess that, more candidly analytical than he, she had\\nlooked fearlessly into the future and had discounted its agonies. She\\nfelt now that she had been tricked into a loveless marriage; that Marten\\nhad purchased her with exactly the same cold calculation of values which\\nhe would have applied to a business undertaking. Willard had proved as\\npotter\\'s clay in his hands, and every turn and twist of the project was\\nclear to her vision as though her husband, yielding to sardonic impulse,\\nhad set forth the unsavory story in black and white. But it was one\\nthing to recognize how she had been duped, and another to strike out\\nboldly for instant freedom. And in that respect the woman was braver\\nthan the man. Power was content to live in the golden present, to stifle\\nthe longings and plaints of silent hours; while the woman who loved him\\nthought only of the end she now held firmly in view and recked little of\\nthe means whereby that end might be achieved.\\n\\nTheir unhappy plight was intensified by the fact that their characters\\nhad deepened and broadened alike during the years of separation. The boy\\nand girl attachment of those heedless days in Colorado might not have\\nwithstood the strain of being thrown together again constantly after so\\nlong an interval, if the woman\\'s nature had not advanced step by step\\nwith the man\\'s. Experience of life, and the educative influences of\\nforeign travel and good society, had done for Nancy what quiet study and\\nseclusion from his fellow-men had done for Power. By such widely\\ndifferent paths they had reached a common standard of earnest purpose\\nand high resolve, and Nancy, at any rate, was passionately determined\\nnot to sacrifice the remainder of her youth because of the unhallowed\\ncompact which sold her to gilded misery and robbed her of her one true\\nmate in all the world.\\n\\nAs she did not blink the consequences, there remained but to carry\\nthrough her desperate scheme as speedily and quietly as was compatible\\nwith no risk of failure. Her one difficulty lay with Power himself. She\\nhad first to break down his sense of honor, a task which could be\\naccomplished only by making him see clearly that her life\\'s happiness\\nwas at stake. And she knew him, oh, so well--far better than he knew\\nhimself! Let Derry once find tears in her eyes, tears which he alone\\ncould dispel, and the seeming fortress of his self-control would crumble\\ninto dust. Let her once twine her arms around him, and what man-made\\nlaws would wrench them apart? For, by her reasoning, the solemn\\nordinances which govern frail human nature were wholly on her side. If\\nmarriage were, indeed, a divine institution, its very essence was\\nprofaned when Hugh Marten laid his sorry plan and made it effective by\\nsheer force of money. She, the woman, would be called on to pay for her\\nliberty in the coin minted of ill-repute, that base metal for whose\\ncurrency her sex was mainly responsible. But those friends whom she\\nvalued would hear the truth, and they would rally round her, never fear!\\nWhy, in this delightful island, where pain and anguish seemed to be\\nbanished by the imperious ukase of deities presiding over the revels of\\nthe rich, people recognized as leaders of society had passed already\\nthrough a furnace of scandal and scathing exposure such as she and her\\nlover would never be called upon to face.\\n\\nAnd that was why Power was at once bewildered and raised to the seventh\\nheaven by her confident, contented smile when they met among the crowd\\nof merrymakers on the yacht, or exchanged a few commonplace words when\\ndoing the round of Narragansett Bay and at dinner that evening in one of\\nNewport\\'s summer palaces.\\n\\nAs his dog-cart was in waiting, he had no excuse to escort her home,\\nbut, in saying goodnight, she contrived again to perplex and delight him\\nby a whispered request.\\n\\n\"Derry,\" she murmured, \"make no outside engagement for tomorrow evening.\\nIf you are already booked up, cry off. I want to dine with you in some\\nquiet place--I suppose there is some hotel or cafe in Newport where\\nnone of our friends go. Find out, and send me a note, telling me the\\ntime and place. I shall come in a hired carriage, and quietly\\ndressed--not in dinner clothes, I mean--and you must do the same. I must\\nhave a long talk with you, wholly independent of our servants, you\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\n\"I shall obey, at any rate,\" he said, with a smile that failed to\\nconceal the unbounded surprise in his eyes. \"May I put a question?\"\\n\\n\"No, not now. Full details later, as people say in telegrams.\"\\n\\nThey parted, and he was so plagued by foreboding that he would have\\ndriven past the Ocean House had not the horse turned in at the gateway\\nof its own accord. If Nancy\\'s manner during the day had shown the least\\ntrace of worry or annoyance, he would have attributed her strange\\nrequest to a desire to take him into her confidence. It was possible,\\nfor instance, that some busybody had warned her that a too marked\\npreference for the society of one man among the many in Newport would\\nprobably reach her husband\\'s ears; but, in that event, her outraged\\npride could never have been veiled by such a mask of unsullied\\ncheerfulness. If any more drastic explanation of the next day\\'s meeting\\nsuggested itself to his troubled mind, he crushed it resolutely. In his\\npresent mood, the slightest hint of scandal associated with Nancy\\'s\\nwinsome personality due to their friendship was anathema. He would have\\nendured any loss, fortune, even life itself, to save her name from\\nbesmirchment.\\n\\nWhen he alighted from the dog-cart he knew it was useless to try and\\nsleep; so he lit a cigar, and sat in a remote corner of the veranda.\\nThen he began seriously to analyze her words. They were to meet in\\nclandestine fashion; not actually in the garments of disguise, but at a\\nrendezvous so remote from the frequenters of the Casino as to run small\\nrisk of being identified. She would drive thither in a \"hired carriage,\"\\nand he was to leave his dog-cart and groom at home. Moreover, she\\ninferred that he would not see her until the evening, since the locality\\nof this _diner a deux_ was to be written; though they had hardly been\\nseparated by longer intervals than a couple of hours between seven\\no\\'clock in the morning and nearly midnight during each day of a\\nfortnight. What did it all portend? Was this to be their last meeting?\\nAt that thought a fierce pain gripped him, and he was sorely tempted to\\ncall the gods to witness that he would not return to a lifetime of\\nwandering in the wilderness. Yet, said a still, small voice within, was\\nit not better so? She was another man\\'s wife. He must remember that,\\nremember it even when his pent-up passions stormed the citadel of his\\nconscience, remember it when the sheer fragrance of her maddened his\\nsenses, remember it when the taste of Dead Sea fruit was bitterest in\\nhis mouth. Of what worth was he if, for her dear sake, he was not strong\\nin knightly resolve? And how could he ever again dare to receive his\\nmother\\'s kiss if he betrayed the trust which she, at least, reposed in\\nhim?\\n\\nA mournful and depressing reverie was disturbed by the arrival of a\\ncarriage at the porch. Four young people alighted--two honeymoon couples\\nthey were supposed to be--and their lively voices seemed to ring the\\nknell of his wrecked existence. He listened, only half hearing, while\\nthey chattered like magpies.\\n\\nThey had been to a dance at the Casino, and their broken comments told\\nof a jolly evening, a capital band, the best floor that ever was laid,\\nsome wonderful dresses, and an unexcelled supper. Similar young people\\nwere telling each other exactly the same inane commonplaces all over the\\neastern part of America at that hour, and similar cackle would girdle\\nthe earth till the crack of doom. Probably the men were wise as he, and\\nthe women might be deemed by their swains pretty as Nancy; yet some\\nmalign despot among the powers which control poor humanity had decreed\\nthat he alone should never know these frivolous moments, never be\\ngranted these breathing-spaces of mild abandonment. And so, wroth with\\nhimself, and vexed with the sorry scheme of things, he went to his\\nrooms.\\n\\nNext morning, to make sure, he rode to Nancy\\'s house. No; Mrs. Marten\\nhad not ordered her horse; in fact, she had not appeared as yet, and the\\npleasant-spoken butler, showing the requisite confidence in the\\ndiscretion of a recognized friend, added that his mistress would not be\\n\"at home\" to anyone before luncheon.\\n\\nThen, the weather being glorious and the air like champagne, Power\\nwhistled care to the devil, and cantered into the town to review the\\nground for the night\\'s fixture.\\n\\nNewport today boasts of almost uncountable hotels and boarding-houses,\\nnor was the area of choice limited in that respect nearly a generation\\nago. After careful scrutiny of various buildings in the business\\nquarter, Power selected a cafe run by a certain Giovanni Pestalozzi as\\nthe most promising. It looked clean and bright, and an Italian might be\\ntrusted to be discreet.\\n\\nGetting a man to hold his horse, he interviewed Giovanni, and was\\nassured that Delmonico\\'s itself could not produce a better meal if the\\nsignor invited comparison. The signor wanted nothing elaborate, however.\\nHe admitted he was not well versed in either menus or wines, but\\ndemanded the best, and, after inspecting a well-furnished room\\noverlooking the street, lodged a ten-dollar bill as earnest money, with\\na promise of ample largess if he were pleased. Then he rode away to the\\nOcean House, sent a note to Nancy, and received a reply which deepened\\nhis mystified dismay.\\n\\nFor she wrote:\\n\\n    \"Dear Derry, I shall be there at seven-thirty. Meanwhile, go to\\n    the Casino, and tell everybody that you are summoned to New York\\n    on business, and mean to leave either tonight by the Fall River\\n    steamer or by first train tomorrow. You are traveling by the train\\n    to oblige me; so I am not asking you to indulge in polite fiction.\\n\\n                                                    \"Yours ever,\\n                                                            \"NANCY.\"\\n\\nHe carried out instructions to the letter, and was chaffed mildly for\\ndeserting the place just as his friends were getting to like him. It was\\neasy to promise a speedy return, if possible; though he felt, somehow,\\nthat he would never see Newport again. The conclusion of his\\nhorse-dealing transactions took up a good deal of the afternoon, and, to\\nhis regret, Dacre was out with a yachting party; so he left a hurriedly\\nwritten message about his pending departure.\\n\\nThen he strolled out, went downtown by street car, and met Nancy when\\nshe alighted from a rickety cab at the door of Pestalozzi\\'s cafe. She\\nwore a cream-tinted dress, and her piquant features were daintily framed\\nin a big Leghorn hat. It pleased him to find that she had not even\\ndeigned to veil her face, and her cheerful cry of recognition showed no\\nconscience-stricken sense of guilt because of a meeting which, if known,\\nmust have excited the suspicions of her intimates.\\n\\n\"Ah, there you are, Derry!\" she said. \"Was there ever a more punctual\\nperson? Am I late? I had such a load of things to do that I left\\ndressing till the last moment. Is this where we dine? What a jolly\\nlittle cafe! It is just like hundreds of such establishments in Rome and\\nNaples. I suppose these Italian restaurateurs employ their\\nfellow-countrymen as builders and decorators; so they carry their\\narchitecture and fittings with them.\"\\n\\n\"They change their skies, but not their soups,\" said Power, falling in\\nwith her mood, and the driver of Nancy\\'s cab recognized the adaptation\\nof Horace\\'s tag, and was pleased to grin, being himself a broken-down\\ngraduate of Harvard.\\n\\nUshered to the dining-room, they tackled the _hors d\\'oeuvres_ at once,\\nand Nancy chatted about current events with the tranquil self-possession\\nshe would have displayed at Mrs. Van Ralten\\'s dinner-table. The meal,\\nexcellently cooked and deftly served, marched to its end without a word\\nfrom her as to its particular purpose. She delighted Pestalozzi by\\ntaking minute instructions for the preparation of an exquisite\\nspaghetti, and even noted the brands of Italian wines which should be\\ntabled with each course. At half-past eight, when coffee appeared, she\\nrose:\\n\\n\"Pay the bill now, Derry,\" she said. \"We must be off in five minutes,\\nand I am sure you want to smoke at least one cigarette in peace. Perhaps\\nSignor Pestalozzi will be good enough to order a cab?\"\\n\\nSignor Pestalozzi was charmed, and decidedly puzzled. He believed for\\nmany a year that those two had dined at his cafe for a wager. If any\\ndoubter scoffed, he would say, with appropriate gesture:\\n\\n\"Sango la Madonna! I tella you he no squeeze-a de gell, not-ta one time;\\nso, if dey no make-a de bet, what-a for he give \\'er dat pranzo superbo?\"\\n\\nReally, from Giovanni\\'s point of view, there was no answer.\\n\\n\"Tell the man to drive us to the Easton\\'s Beach end of the Cliff Walk,\"\\nshe said nonchalantly, when the cab was in evidence, and away they went.\\n\\n\"There is no moon; but these summer nights are never quite dark,\" she\\nbegan, by way of polite conversation. \"It ought to be restful tonight\\ndown there by the Atlantic. It is a horrid thing to confess, but the\\nmemories of Venice which are most vivid in my mind are not connected\\nwith St. Mark\\'s or the Doge\\'s Palace, but center round just such a night\\nas this on the Lido. Coming back in the gondola, I almost wanted to slip\\nover the side into the still waters, and drift away to the unknown.\"\\n\\n\"Do we swim tonight, then?\" he asked.\\n\\nIt was a relief to hear his own voice in some such apparently\\nlight-hearted quip. The cab was narrow, and hung on indifferent springs,\\nand its lurching across the roadway to avoid other vehicles often threw\\nhim against Nancy\\'s supple body. He could never touch her without\\nfeeling the thrill of contact, and, fight as he would against it, the\\ndesire to clasp her in his arms and stifle her protests with hot kisses\\nwould come on him at such moments with an almost overwhelming ecstasy.\\n\\n\"If I led, would you follow, Derry?\" she whispered.\\n\\nHeaven help him, it seemed as though she was nestling close\\ndeliberately; yet he refused to believe, and strove to answer with a\\njest.\\n\\n\"I have a picture of you and me striking out across the bay for\\nNarragansett, like a pair of dolphins,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I thought of you that night on the Lido,\" she went on, unheeding. \"I\\nimagined then that when you skipped off to Sacramento you had forgotten\\nthe little girl of the Dolores ranch. At any rate, such was my every-day\\ncommon-sense sort of belief; but tucked away in some cute little nerve\\ncenter of intuition was another notion, which told me that we had been\\ndriven apart by wicked and deceitful contriving. And now, thank my\\nstars, I know that my subconscious feeling was right! Oh, Derry! How you\\nmust have despised me! What if we had not met for many a year, and you\\nhad schooled yourself into real forgetfulness, and some other girl had\\ncrept into a corner of your heart, thrusting out poor little me\\nforever?\"\\n\\nThe gathering gloom without had now made the cab\\'s interior so dark\\nthat she could not see the rigid lines in his face, nor could she make\\nout by any convulsive movement that his hands were clenched, and that\\nbeads of perspiration stood on his forehead. But she knew, yes, she\\nknew, and timid fingers caught his arm.\\n\\n\"You are not to think me mad or cruel to speak in this way,\" she cooed.\\n\"I have looked into my very soul, Dear, and a great peace has come from\\nmy self-communing. You have wearied your clever brain with guesses as to\\nmy motive in meeting you tonight, and I giggled like a schoolgirl today\\nat the thought of your absolute amazement when you read my note bidding\\nyou prepare to leave Newport. But it is all part and parcel of my plan,\\nDerry, which rests on your reply to one small question. Do you want to\\ngo away from _me_? Are you ready to face a world in which there will be\\nno Nancy, never, no more?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you are trying me beyond endurance!\" he almost sobbed.\\n\\n\"But you _must_ tell me _that_, Derry. I have gone a long way daringly.\\nIt is my privilege, my right. If you love me, you must expect it of me,\\nbecause, as things are, I am forced to take the first step. But a woman\\nmust be sure that she is loved, and her lover alone can still her\\ndoubts.\"\\n\\nAn impulse stronger than his own strength of will brought strange, wild\\nwords to his dry lips.\\n\\n\"Nancy,\" he said, with the calm accents of despair, \"I have never loved\\nany woman but you, and, God willing, I never shall!\"\\n\\n\"That is all that really matters,\" she sighed, with a contented note in\\nher voice that rang in his ears like a chord of sweet music heard from\\nafar in the depths of a forest.\\n\\nAfter that they sat in silence, she seemingly wrapped in dreams, and he\\nwandering in a maze wherein impassable walls showed no gateway of\\nescape; though the guarded path was alluring, and the air was heavy with\\nthe scent of flowers.\\n\\nThe cab stopped, and they alighted; for Nancy, demurely self-controlled,\\nannounced that she meant to take him for a stroll along the Cliff Walk.\\nPower, deaf and blind to externals, would have accompanied her\\nstraightway; but she laughingly called him back from the clouds.\\n\\n\"Tell the cabman to wait,\" she said, \"and give him some money, or the\\npoor fellow will think that we have come this long way from town\\npurposely, and mean to go off without payment.\"\\n\\nHe handed the driver a subsidy which caused the man to avow his\\nwillingness to wait till morning if necessary. Once away from the main\\nroad, and with no other company than the stars and the sea, Nancy took\\nher escort\\'s arm, and kept step with him.\\n\\n\"Now,\" she said, \"I\\'m perversely disinclined to discuss personal affairs\\nuntil we reach a certain rock at the foot of the Forty Steps. I mean to\\nsit on that rock, and you will curl up on the shingle at my feet, and\\nlight a nice-smelling cigar, and listen while I explain the method in my\\nmadness of the last twenty-four hours. But I cannot arrange my thoughts\\nin sequence till we are settled there comfortably. In the meantime, I\\'ll\\nmake you acquainted with my best friend, the Duchesse de Brasnes, whom\\nyou will meet some day in Paris, I hope, and then you will see for\\nyourself some of her delightful eccentricities which I\\'ll recount to you\\nnow, and you will laugh quietly and say, \\'What an observant little\\nperson that Nancy is! Now, who\\'d have thought she could quiz and con a\\ngreat lady of the Faubourg so accurately?\\' But you\\'re not to\\nmisunderstand my joking; for the duchess is a dear, and I\\'m very fond of\\nher.\"\\n\\nTo this day Power has never recalled a single syllable of Nancy\\'s\\nutterances concerning one of the leaders of Parisian society. All that\\nhe knew, or cared to know, was that the voice of his beloved was\\nmurmuring words which were curiously soothing to his tingling nerves. By\\nthis time he had cast scruples to the winds. His mind was armored with\\ntriple steel against any other consideration than that Nancy was by his\\nside, that her hand rested confidently on his wrist, that he could feel\\nher slender arm warm and soft near his heart.\\n\\nAnd the supreme moment was rushing upon him with the wings of love on a\\nsummer\\'s night, than which no flight of bird is so swift and noiseless.\\nThey reached the top of the rocky staircase, and began to descend. A\\nfairy radiance from off the dark-blue mirror of the Atlantic made plain\\neach downward step; but Nancy wore the high-heeled shoes which women\\naffected then more generally than is the fashion today, and Power held\\nher hand lest she slipped and fell. Thus they made their way to the\\nbeach, until they had almost negotiated the last short flight. Power,\\nindeed, was standing on the shingle, and the girl--for, married woman\\nthough she was, her years were still those of a girl--was poised\\ngracefully on the lowermost slab.\\n\\nThere she hesitated perceptibly. His eyes met hers in a subtle\\nunderlook, and he saw that her face was deathly white. Yet there was\\nneither fear nor indecision in her steadfast glance. Even while he asked\\ndumbly why she waited, her lips parted, she held out her hands with a\\ngesture of pleading, and she murmured:\\n\\n\"Oh, Derry, my own dear love, it is not the first but the last step\\nwhich counts now!\"\\n\\nThen he took her in his arms, and their lips met--and for her there was\\nno uncertainty ever more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nTHE STEP THAT COUNTED\\n\\n\\nOf course, being a woman, she made believe that he had taken her by\\nstorm.\\n\\n\"Derry, dear, how _could_ you?\" she gasped, all rosy and breathless, and\\nseemingly much occupied in smoothing her ruffled plumes during the first\\nlull after the hurricane.\\n\\n\"You witch, who could resist you?\" he muttered, showing well-marked\\nsymptoms of another attack.\\n\\n\"No, you\\'ll just behave, and sit exactly where I shall point out!\" she\\ncried, and her pouting confidence gave eloquent testimony to the passing\\nof an indelible phase in their relations. \"And I am not a witch; but if\\nyou find it necessary to resist me, as you put it---- Well, there! only\\nthis once. We _must_ sit down and be serious. I have such a lot to say,\\nand so little time in which to say it.\"\\n\\nThe new note struck by the unfettered intimacy of her manner exercised\\nan influence which Power would have regarded as a fantastic\\nimpossibility during those moments of delirium when first she clung to\\nhim, and both were shaken by irrepressible tumult. It said, far more\\nplainly than impassioned speech, that she had thrown down all barriers,\\nthat she had counted the cost, and was giving herself freely and gladly\\nto her mate. The recognition of this supreme surrender by a proud\\nwoman, a woman to whom purity of thought was as the breath of life,\\nadministered a beneficial shock to his sorely tried nerves. Had a\\nbrilliant meteor flashed suddenly through space, and rushed headlong\\ntoward that part of the Atlantic which lapped the southern shore of\\nRhode Island, it could not have illuminated land and sea with more\\nincisive clarity than did Nancy\\'s attitude light up the dark places of\\nhis mind. Some stupendous thing had happened which would account for\\nthis miracle, and he must endeavor to understand. No matter what the\\neffort needed, he must attend to her every word. In his inmost heart he\\nknew that he cared not a jot what set of circumstances had brought about\\na development which he had not dared to dream of. He recked little of\\nthe cause now that its effect was graven on tablets more lasting than\\nbrass. But it was due to Nancy that he should be able to follow and\\nappreciate her motives. He held fast to that thought in the midst of a\\nvertigo. A waking nightmare had been changed in an instant into a\\nbeatitude akin, perilously akin, to that of the man and woman who found\\neach other in the one perfect garden which this gray old world has seen,\\nand no darkling vision of desert wastes and thorn-choked paths tortured\\nthe happy lovers now gazing fearlessly into each other\\'s shining eyes.\\nThe heritage of \"man\\'s first disobedience\" might oppress them all too\\nsoon; but, for that night at least, it lay hidden behind the veil.\\nExercising no slight command on his self-control, therefore, Power\\nstrove to revert to the well-ordered coherency of speech and action\\nwhich he had schooled himself to adopt when in Nancy\\'s presence.\\n\\n\"Forgive me if I have seemed rather mad,\" he pleaded, seating himself at\\nher feet, and simulating a calmness which resembled the placid center of\\na cyclone. \"During three long years I have hungered for the taste of\\nyour lips, Dear. That is my excuse, and it should serve; for I was\\ncontent to wait as many decades if Fate kept firm in her resolve to deny\\nyou to me.\"\\n\\n\"You would never have yielded if I had not used a woman\\'s guile?\" she\\nsaid, half questioning him, half stating a truism beyond reach of\\nargument.\\n\\n\"There is little of guile in your nature, Nancy.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I think that is true, too; but it is equally true that a woman\\noften takes what I may call a saner view of life than a man. She is\\nquicker to admit the logic of accepted facts. If you discovered that\\nsome girl had won by false pretense, not your love, for love gilds the\\ngrossest clay, but your respect, as her husband, you would not spurn her\\nwith the loathing I feel now for the man who made me his wife. For that\\nis what it has come to. I refuse to pose as Hugh Marten\\'s wife in the\\neyes of the world one moment longer than is needful to obtain my\\nfreedom. His wife I have never been in the eyes of Heaven, because my\\nHeaven is a place of love and content, and I have neither loved my\\nhusband nor been content with him, not for a single instant. Our\\nmarriage began with a lie, and has endured on a basis of lies. Such\\ncontracts, I believe, are void in law, and the principle which governs\\nmen in business should at least apply to that most solemn of all\\nengagements, the lifelong union of husband and wife. Hugh Marten\\nconspired with my father--hired him, I might rather say--to drive you\\nand me apart, Derry. The stronger and more subtle brain devised the\\nmeans, and left it to the weaker one to carry out the scheme in sordid\\nreality. As for me, I was helpless as a caged bird. How was I to guess\\nthat Marten, whom I knew only as the owner of the Bison mines and mills,\\nhad planned my capture? Even my poor, weak father did not suspect it\\ntill you were hundreds of miles away in California. And then how\\nskilfully was the trap baited, and how swiftly it worked! You had not\\nreached Sacramento before a lawyer wrote from Denver warning my father\\nthat the mortgagees were about to foreclose on the ranch. On several\\noccasions previously he had been in arrears with the interest on the\\nloan; but they had always proved considerate, and their just claims were\\nmet, sooner or later. Yet, in a year when scores of well-to-do ranchers\\nwere pressed for money, and when clemency became almost a right, these\\npeople proved implacable, and swooped down on him like a hawk on a\\ncrippled pigeon.... Derry, _you_ bought the place--who were they?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. I dealt through a lawyer, and the vendor was Mr.\\nWillard. He sold the property free of any encumbrance.\"\\n\\n\"Yet local opinion credited you and Mac with being a shrewd pair!\" she\\ncommented, laughing softly, as if she were reviewing some tragi-comedy\\nin a quizzical humor.\\n\\n\"We certainly wondered why Marten made things so easy for us--in other\\nrespects,\" he volunteered.\\n\\n\"Ah, then, you _did_ have a glimmering suspicion of the truth? I guessed\\nit; though I could not be absolutely certain till yesterday morning,\\nwhen Mr. Benson refused to answer my pointblank question. He would not\\nlie, but he dared not tell the truth; so he fell back on the feeble\\nsubterfuge that, after the mighty interval of three and a half years, he\\ncould not recall the exact facts.\"\\n\\n\"Benson? Did you write to him?\"\\n\\nThe surprise in Power\\'s voice was not feigned. He was beginning to see\\nnow something of the fixed purpose which had governed her actions during\\nthe past twenty-four hours.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said composedly. \"It was hardly necessary, but I wanted to\\ndispose of my last doubt; though in my own mind I was sure of the ground\\nalready. My father went straight to Denver on receipt of that letter,\\nand, of course, chanced to travel by the same train as Hugh Marten, the\\nman to whom the whole amount of the mortgage was little more than a\\nday\\'s income. Marten was gracious, the lawyer-man adamant. Within a week\\nI was told of a new suitor, and of my father\\'s certain and complete ruin\\nif I refused him.... Ah, me! How I wept!... When did you post your first\\nletter, Derry?\"\\n\\n\"Two days after I arrived at the placer mine,\" he replied\\nunhesitatingly. The chief revelation in Nancy\\'s story was her\\ncrystal-clear knowledge of facts which, he flattered himself, he had\\nkept from her ken. Then his heart leaped at the thought that she had\\nknown of his love from the night they met in the dining-room of the\\nOcean House. But he choked back the rush of sentiment; for she was\\ndemanding his close attention.\\n\\n\"And I wrote on or about that same date,\" she went on. \"My\\nfather--Heaven forgive him!--stole your letters to me; but the scheme\\nfor suppressing my letters to you must have been concocted before you\\nwent to Sacramento. Such foul actions are unforgivable! I, for one,\\nrefuse to be bound by the fetters which they forged. I come to you, my\\ndear, as truly your wife, as unstained in soul and body, as though Hugh\\nMarten had never existed!\"\\n\\nA sudden note of passion vibrated in her voice, and Power realized, by a\\nlightning flash of intuition, with what vehement decision she had\\nsevered already the knot which seemed to bind her so tightly. He fancied\\nit was her due that he should endeavor to relax an emotional strain\\nwhich was becoming unbearable.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a mighty good thing we are Americans,\" he said. \"Here divorce is\\nneither hard to obtain nor highly objectionable in its methods. We--at\\nany rate, I--must consult some lawyer of experience. The laws differ in\\nthe various states. That which is murder and sudden death in Ohio is a\\nfive-dollar proposition in Illinois; but the legal intellect will throw\\nlight on our difficulty. Meanwhile----\"\\n\\nHe stopped awkwardly, aware that, although she was apparently listening\\nto his words, they were making no impression on her senses. A sudden\\nsilence fell, and the hitherto unheeded noises of the night smote on his\\nears with uncanny loudness. The leisured plash of waves so tiny that\\nthey might not be dignified by the name of breakers swelled into a\\ncertain strength and volume as his range of hearing spread, and the\\nfaint cries of invisible sea-fowl now jarred loudly on the quietude of\\nnature. A pebble rolled down the cliff, and he could mark its constantly\\naccelerated leaps until it reached the shingle with a crash which, even\\nto a case-hardened pebble, betokened damage.\\n\\n\"Meanwhile----\" prompted Nancy, in a still, small voice.\\n\\nSo she had followed what he was saying. What was it that he meant to\\nsay? Something about the rocks and shoals that lay ahead before he could\\ntake her to some safe anchorage. Nevertheless, he shied off at a\\ntangent, and chose haphazard the one topic which his sober judgment\\nmight have avoided.\\n\\n\"I was about to utter a banal remark; but it may as well be put on\\nrecord and dismissed,\" he said. \"It is fortunate that I am a rich man.\\nMere weight of money can achieve nothing against us; while the\\npossession of ample means will simplify matters in so far as we are\\nconcerned personally.\"\\n\\n\"Were those really the words on the tip of your tongue, Derry?\"\\n\\n\"Well, no,\" he admitted.\\n\\n\"Are you afraid of hurting my feelings?\"\\n\\n\"You are right, Dear. As between you and me there should be no\\nconcealment. We have to face the immediate future. We must consider how\\nto surmount the interval, short though it may be----\"\\n\\n\"Interval! What interval?\"\\n\\n\"You cannot secure a divorce without some sort of legal process, and the\\nlaw refuses to be hurried.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes. Divorce--law--they are words which have little meaning here\\nand now.\"\\n\\n\"But they are all-important. Awhile ago you spoke of your Paris friends,\\nand there are others, like Mrs. Van Ralten, whose sympathies and help\\nwill be of real value in years to come. You see, I want you to hold\\nyour pretty little head higher as Mrs. John Darien Power than you ever\\nheld it as Mrs. Hugh Marten.\"\\n\\n\"That will cost no great effort, Derry. If we have to pass through an\\nordeal of publicity, we can surely use the vile means for our own ends,\\nso that our friends may know the whole truth.... Derry, if you were not\\nsuch a good and honorable man, you would not be so dense.\"\\n\\nIn his anxiety to follow each twist and turn of her reasoning he had\\ncrept nearer, and was now on his knees, having imprisoned her hands in\\nhis, and peering intently into her face. In that dim light her eyes\\nshone like faintly luminous twin stars, and he laughed joyously when, to\\nhis thinking, he had solved the doubt that was troubling her.\\n\\n\"If it will help any that all the world should know that I, the\\naforesaid John Darien Power, have been, and am, and will ever remain\\nfrantically in love with a lady heretofore described as Nancy Willard, I\\nshall nail a signed statement to that effect on the Casino notice-board\\ntomorrow morning,\" he vowed.\\n\\nShe gently released her hands, placed them lovingly on his cheeks, and\\ndrew him close, so that he could not choose but yield to any demand she\\nmight make.\\n\\n\"Derry,\" she said, kissing him with that soothing air of maternity which\\nis a woman\\'s highest endowment, \"though I am going to say something\\ndreadfully forward and bold, I shall risk all lest I lose you, and, if\\nthat happens, my poor heart will break and be at rest forever. Even now\\nyou do not see whither I am leading you. You never would see unless I\\nspoke plainly. My love for you may be fierce and terrible; but I am\\nonly a weak woman, a woman just emerged from girlhood, and I want to be\\nsaved from myself. If, for your dear sake, I am to cut adrift from the\\npast, I cannot be left alone. By your side I can face the storm, but I\\nshudder at the thought of protests, appeals, influences perhaps more\\npotent than I imagine in my present new-found mood of hatred of the\\nwrong which has been done me. Derry, why, do you think, have I asked you\\nto leave Newport early tomorrow?\"\\n\\nStirred by a common impulse, they both stood upright. All at once she\\nseemed to be unable to bear his burning gaze any longer, and her head\\nsank on his breast. He had thrown a protecting arm around her shoulders,\\nand he felt her supple body quiver under a sob which she tried to\\nrestrain.\\n\\n\"Nancy,\" he whispered, \"am I to take you with me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said brokenly.\\n\\n\"You mean that we are to be a law unto ourselves, and thereby make\\ndivorce proceedings inevitable? I must put it that way, my dear one! I\\nmust understand!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Derry. You _must_ understand. There is no other way.\"\\n\\nHe held her so tightly that he became aware of the mad racing of her\\nheart, and a great pity stirred his inmost core. How she must have\\nsuffered! What agony was this forced discarding, one by one, of her\\nmaidenly defenses! Though he had been blind and deaf solely because of\\nthe depth and intensity of his love and reverence, he could utter now\\nonly a halting plea that would explain his slowness of perception.\\n\\n\"Forgive me, Dear!\" he murmured. \"I can find nothing better to say than\\nthat--forgive me! I was so absorbed in my own dream of happiness that I\\ngave no heed to the means. But I shall never again be so thoughtless.\"\\n\\n\"Thoughtless!\" She raised her sweet face once more, tear-stained and\\nsmiling. \"You thoughtless, Derry? Women thank God for that sort of\\nthoughtlessness in men like you!\"\\n\\nAnd with that, before he could forestall or even divine her intention,\\nshe had withdrawn from his embrace, and had run lightly up half a dozen\\nof the Forty Steps.\\n\\n\"Come!\" she cried, with an alteration of manner and voice that was\\nalmost stupefying to her hearer. \"We have been here an unconscionable\\ntime, and just think how awful it will be if our cabman has taken home\\nhis tired horse! Of course, even at the twelfth hour, I have loads of\\nthings to pack. And, since I don\\'t know where I am going, the task of\\nselecting a reasonable stock of clothes is too appalling for words. Oh,\\ndon\\'t gaze at me as if I were a ghost, Derry! I am not about to flit\\naway into space. You will have another half hour of my company; because,\\nlet that poor horse do his best, we sha\\'n\\'t reach our respective\\nhabitations till long after eleven o\\'clock.\"\\n\\nYet she was neither excited nor hysterical. A great load had been lifted\\noff her heart, and her naturally gay temperament was asserting itself\\nwith vital insistence. There was no possibility of drawing back now.\\nNothing but death could separate her from her lover. Nothing but death!\\nWell, that separation must come in the common order of things; but a\\nbright road stretched before her mind\\'s eye through a long vista of\\nyears, and her spirit sang within her and rejoiced exceedingly. No shred\\nof doubt or hesitation remained. She had passed already through the\\nstorm, and though its clouds might roll in sullen thunder among distant\\nhills yet awhile, the particular hilltop on which she stood was bathed\\nin sunlight.\\n\\nAbove all else, despite her complete trust in Power, she thrilled with\\nthe consciousness that her love contained a delicious spice of fear, and\\nthat is why she climbed the Forty Steps in a sort of panic; so that he\\nmarveled at her change of mood, and discovered in it only one more of\\nthe enchantments with which his fancy clothed her.\\n\\nThe driver regarded them as a moonstruck couple, since that sort of moon\\nshines ever on fine evenings by the sea. He was obviously surprised when\\nthe lady\\'s address was given, because he expected a return journey to\\none of Newport\\'s many boarding-houses; but any suspicions he may have\\nentertained were dispelled when he witnessed a polite farewell in the\\npresence of a pompous butler, and heard Nancy say:\\n\\n\"I am going straight to my room now to write that letter to my father.\\nThen I shall finish packing. What time is the train--nine o\\'clock.\\nGoodnight, Derry! Sleep well!\"\\n\\nIf he thought at all about the matter, the cabman might well have\\nimagined that no young lady in Newport that night had used words less\\ncharged with explosive properties; yet no giant cannon on the warships\\nswinging to their moorings in the bay could have rivaled the uproar\\nthose few simple sentences might create. Moreover, he heard the\\ngentleman address the butler by name, and witnessed the transference of\\na tip, accompanied by the plain statement that the giver was leaving\\nNewport early next day. Indeed, once he had deposited his fare at the\\nOcean House, the man probably gave no further heed to one or other of\\nthe pair who had some foolish liking for a prolonged stroll on the\\ncliffs overlooking the Atlantic, nor, to his knowledge, did he ever\\nagain see them, or even hear their names spoken of.\\n\\nPower was crossing the veranda with his alert, uneven strides when a\\nvoice came out of the gloom:\\n\\n\"Hullo, Power, that you? Come and join me in a parting drink.\"\\n\\nIt was Dacre, the one person in the hotel from whom such an invitation\\nwas not an insufferable nuisance at the moment.\\n\\n\"I\\'m in a bit of a hurry,\" said Power, \"as I am off tomorrow morning;\\nbut I\\'m glad to find you here. You\\'ve received my note?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Sit down. I\\'m just going to light a cigar, and the match will help\\nyou to mix your own poison. Had a pleasant evening?\"\\n\\nIt was a natural though curiously pertinent question; but Power was at\\nno loss for an answer.\\n\\n\"I have really been arranging certain details as a preliminary to my\\ndeparture,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Where are you bound for, New York?\"\\n\\n\"After some days, or weeks, perhaps. I hardly know yet.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve changed your plans, it seems?\"\\n\\nPower remembered then that he had invited the Englishman to visit\\nColorado. It was practically settled that Dacre should come West within\\nthree weeks or a month.\\n\\n\"By Jove!\" he cried, \"you must accept my apologies. Of course, I would\\nhave recalled our fixture in good time, and have written postponing your\\ntrip to Bison. Circumstances beyond my control will prevent my return\\nhome for an indefinite period. I can\\'t tell you how sorry I am.\"\\n\\n\"Same here,\" said the other, with John Bull directness.\\n\\n\"But neither of us is likely to shuffle off the map yet awhile,\"\\ncontinued Power. \"You have my address, both in Colorado and at my New\\nYork bank, and I have yours. Keep me posted as to your movements, and we\\nshall come together again later in the year.\"\\n\\nHe was eager to dissipate a certain starchiness, not wholly\\nunjustifiable, which he thought he could detect in his companion\\'s\\nmanner; but the discovery of its true cause disconcerted him more than\\nhe cared to acknowledge, even to himself. Enlightenment was not long\\ndelayed. Dacre\\'s evident lack of ease arose from circumstances vastly\\nmore important than the disruption of his own plans; he hesitated only\\nbecause he was searching for the right way to express himself.\\n\\n\"You and I have cultivated quite a friendship since we forgathered here\\nnearly three weeks ago,\" he began, after a pause which Power again\\ninterpreted mistakenly.\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed. Won\\'t you let me explain----\"\\n\\n\"Not just yet. You are on the wrong tack, Power. You believe I\\'m rather\\ncut up about the postponement of your invitation. Not a bit of it. This\\nlittle globe cannot hold two men like you and me, and keep us apart\\nduring the remainder of our naturals. No, mine is a different sort of\\ngrouch. Now, I\\'m a good deal older than you. You won\\'t take amiss\\nanything I tell you, providing I make it clear that I mean well?\"\\n\\n\"I can guarantee that, at any rate.\"\\n\\nPower\\'s reply was straightforward enough; but his tone was cold and\\nguarded. The chill of premonition had fallen on him. A man whom he liked\\nand respected was about to fire the first shot on behalf of unctuous\\nrectitude and the conventions.\\n\\n\"I may as well open with a broadside,\" said Dacre, unwittingly adopting\\nthe simile of social warfare which had occurred to his hearer. \"I was\\nout with a yachting party this afternoon, and we were becalmed. Three of\\nus came away from the New York Yacht Club\\'s boathouse about half-past\\neight, and took a street-car in preference to one of those rickety old\\ncabs. Luckily, by the accident of position, I was the only one of the\\nthree who saw a lady and gentleman come out of an Italian restaurant.\\nThe presence of two such people in that locality was unusual, to say the\\nleast; but, as the man was a friend of mine, and the lady one whom I\\nadmire and respect, I said nothing to the other fellows.\"\\n\\n\"That was thoughtful of you,\" broke in Power, half in sarcasm; for he\\nwas vastly irritated that he had not contrived affairs more discreetly,\\nand half in genuine recognition of Dacre\\'s tact.\\n\\n\"The thinking came later,\" said the Englishman slowly. \"When all is\\nsaid and done, a little dinner _a l\\'Italienne_ might pass by way of a\\njoke--a harmless escapade at the best, or worst. But, when I reach my\\nhotel and find a note announcing that the man is leaving Newport\\nunexpectedly, and when I hear at the Casino that the woman also is\\narranging to meet her father in New York, with equal unexpectedness, I\\nam inclined to ask the man, he being something more than a mere\\nacquaintance, if there is not a very reasonable probability that he is\\nmaking a damned fool of himself. Now, are we going to discuss this thing\\nrationally, or do you want to hit me with a heavy siphon? If the latter,\\nkindly change your mind, and let\\'s talk about the next race for the\\nAmerica\\'s Cup.\"\\n\\nHere no solemn diapason of wave and shingle relieved an unnerving\\nsilence. Not even the distant rumble of a vehicle broke the tension. The\\nhour was late for ordinary traffic, early for diners and dancers. A deep\\nhush lay on the hotel and its garden. It was so dark that the street\\nlamps, twinkling few and far between the trees, appeared to diffuse no\\nlarger area of light than so many fireflies.\\n\\n\"Are we alone here?\" said Power, speaking only when an uneasy movement\\non Dacre\\'s part bestirred him.\\n\\n\"Yes. I saw to that when I heard your cab. I timed you to a nicety.\"\\n\\n\"You must be experienced in these matters.\"\\n\\n\"I have been most sorts of an idiot in my time.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite sure we are not overheard?\"\\n\\n\"As sure as a man can be of anything.\"\\n\\n\"Then I recognize your right to question me. Tonight you, tomorrow all\\nNewport, will know what has happened----\"\\n\\n\"Pardon an interruption. Women are invariably careful of the hour,\\nhowsoever heedless they may be of next week. Newport knows nothing, will\\nknow nothing, except that a popular lady is meeting her father in New\\nYork, the said father having written to say he is coming East. His\\nletter is Exhibit A, yours to me Exhibit B, or it would be if it weren\\'t\\nburnt.\"\\n\\n\"A legal jargon is not out of place. When the lady in question has\\nsecured a divorce she will become my wife. Now you have the true\\nexplanation of my seeming discourtesy. When I am married, I shall\\nentertain you at Bison if I have to escort you from Tokio, or even from\\nSing Sing.\"\\n\\n\"But----\"\\n\\n\"There are no \\'buts.\\' She was stolen from me, decoyed away by the tricks\\nof the pickpocket and the forger. I am merely regaining possession of my\\nown. It was not I who cleared up the theft. That was her doing. There\\ncan be no shirking the consequences. If my mother, whom I love and\\nvenerate, implored me on her bended knees to draw back now from the\\ncourse I have mapped out, I would stop my ears to her pleading, because\\nI could not yield to it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s like that, is it?\"\\n\\n\"Just like that.\"\\n\\nDacre struck another match, and relighted the cigar which he had allowed\\nto go out after the first whiff or two. Power noticed that the flare of\\nthe match was not used as an excuse for scrutinizing him, because his\\nfriend\\'s eyes were studiously averted. Then came the quiet, cultured\\nvoice from the darkness:\\n\\n\"If that\\'s the position, old man, I wish you every sort of good luck,\\nand a speedy end to your worries, and I\\'ll come at your call to that\\nranch of yours, from the other end of the earth, if need be.\"\\n\\nAgain a little pause. Then Power spoke:\\n\\n\"You ring like true metal all the time, Dacre. May I ask you one\\nthing--are you married?\"\\n\\n\"No, nor ever likely to be. I--I lost her, not by fraud, but by my own\\nfolly. But she understood--before she died. That is my only consolation.\\nIt must suffice. It has sufficed.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry. I touched that chord unthinkingly. I merely wanted to have\\nyour full comprehension--and sympathy.\"\\n\\n\"You had both already. I would not have dared to intrude if I did not\\nrealize that a man talking to another man can raise points which are\\nlost sight of when a woman--_the_ woman--is the other party to the\\ndebate.\"\\n\\n\"Would you care to hear a brief record of my life during the last few\\nyears?\"\\n\\n\"Go right ahead! I\\'m not a gossip. If I know something of the truth, I\\nmay be able to stop a rill of scandal one of these days. There\\'s bound\\nto be chatter, even though old Mr. Willard comes East.\"\\n\\n\"You know the name, then?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. Mrs. Van Ralten was speaking about him tonight--not very\\nfavorably, either. Said she couldn\\'t understand how such a man could\\nhave such a daughter.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs. Van Ralten is a remarkably intelligent woman,\" said Power dryly.\\n\"I never saw Nancy\\'s mother; but I imagine that this is a case of\\nexclusive heredity, because there never were two more diverse natures\\nthan Nancy\\'s and her father\\'s. She is the soul of honor, and would give\\nher life for a principle; while he bartered his own daughter for a few\\nthousand dollars. If I were not convinced of that, do you believe I\\nwould besmirch her good name and my own by so much as tonight\\'s mild\\nadventure in an Italian cafe?\"\\n\\n\"I can give you easy assurance on that head. I have seldom been so\\nsurprised as when I saw the pair of you leaving the place and entering a\\ncab.\"\\n\\n\"That was a mere episode, a first meek onslaught on the proprieties, so\\nto speak. You will understand fully when I have told you the whole\\nstory.\"\\n\\nThey talked, or rather Power talked and Dacre listened, till a clock\\nstruck twelve somewhere. Carriages began to roll along the neighboring\\navenues, and lamps occasionally flitted past the hotel. Two or three\\nvivacious groups crossed the veranda, and a porter turned on a lamp.\\nThen Power found that his English friend had placed their chairs in a\\nsort of alcove formed by a disused doorway flanked on each hand by a\\nhuge palm growing in a wooden tub which held a ton of earth, or more; so\\nthey were well screened.\\n\\n\"You meant to force me to confess,\" he said, smiling.\\n\\n\"Yes. It might have been merely folly on your part.\"\\n\\n\"But now?\"\\n\\n\"Now it is Fate\\'s own contriving. You don\\'t want to escape; but you\\ncouldn\\'t if you did. Or, that is awkwardly put. What I mean is----\"\\n\\nDacre\\'s meaning was clear enough; but he never completed the sentence. A\\ncab, laden with luggage, drove up, and a slightly built, elderly man\\nalighted.\\n\\n\"This the Ocean House?\" he inquired, when a porter hurried forward.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" and the man took a portmanteau from the driver.\\n\\n\"Hold on, there! I\\'m not sure I shall want a room. How far is \\'The\\nBreakers\\' from here, Mrs. Marten\\'s house?\"\\n\\n\"Quite a ways,\" said the cabman. \"Two miles an\\' a bit.\"\\n\\nThe new arrival seemed to consider the distance and the lateness of the\\nhour.\\n\\n\"Is Mrs. Marten in Newport, do you know?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yep. I tuk her downtown this evenin\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Alone?\"\\n\\n\"Guess that\\'s so.\"\\n\\n\"Where was she going?\"\\n\\n\"Wall, ye see, I was on the box, an\\' de lady was inside; so we didn\\'t\\ngit anyways sociable.\"\\n\\nThe stranger evidently bethought himself, and turned to the porter\\nagain. He could not know that a Harvard man was merely speaking in the\\nvernacular. \"Have you a Mr. Power staying here?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Is he here now?\"\\n\\n\"If he isn\\'t in the hotel, he\\'ll be at the Casino. Shall I ring up his\\nroom, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, no. I\\'ll see him in the morning. It\\'s too late to go any farther\\ntonight, and I\\'m rather tired and shaken up. My train was derailed, and\\nwe are hours behind time. Give me a decent room. I suppose I can have\\nbreakfast at eight o\\'clock?\"\\n\\n\"Any time you like, sir.\"\\n\\nThe cab went off, and the inquisitive visitor entered the building. The\\ntwo men seated behind the palms had not uttered a syllable while the\\nforegoing conclave was in progress.\\n\\n\"Mr. Francis Willard, I presume?\" murmured Dacre, when the retreating\\nfootsteps had died away.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Power.\\n\\n\"Three days ahead of the time stated in his letter, I presume further.\"\\n\\n\"That must be so.\"\\n\\n\"Foxy. He fits your description. What are you going to do now?\"\\n\\n\"Finish my yarn, if I am not wearying you, and leave Newport at seven\\nA.M. instead of nine-ten. The fox broke cover just a little too soon.\"\\n\\n\"By gad, yes! I think I\\'ll recognize that cabman again. If I come across\\nhim, I\\'ll tip him for you. He deserves it.... The swine! To start\\npumping the townsfolk before he was ten seconds in the place, and about\\nhis own daughter, too! Dash his eyes--wait till someone refers him to me\\nfor news of you! I\\'ll head him into the open country quick enough--trust\\nme!\"\\n\\nDacre\\'s comments might sound rather incoherent; but it was painfully\\nevident that Nancy\\'s father had created a bad first impression, and he\\nwas one of those unhappy mortals who could not afford to do that,\\nbecause he never survived it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nTHE CHASE\\n\\n\\nIn the morning Power\\'s first care was to ascertain the position of the\\nroom allotted to Willard. As he imagined, it proved to be in the back\\npart of the hotel, every apartment in the front section being occupied\\nby season residents. Shortly before six o\\'clock, therefore, he drove\\naway in an open carriage, confident that nothing short of an almost\\nincredible chance would bring the older man to vestibule or porch at\\nthat early hour. Halting the vehicle at a corner near Nancy\\'s abode, he\\nwalked to the house, and surprised the earliest servants astir by\\nbidding one of them wake Mrs. Marten at once, as he had news of her\\nfather.\\n\\n\"Nothing serious,\" he added, with a reassuring smile at a housemaid\\nwhose alarmed face showed an immediate sense of disaster. \"Mrs. Marten\\nis leaving Newport today, I think, and my message may decide her to\\nstart sooner--that is all.\"\\n\\nBut Nancy had seen him from her bedroom window, and now fluttered\\ndownstairs in a dressing gown.\\n\\n\"What is it, Derry?\" she asked, and mistress and maid evidently shared\\nthe feminine belief that such an untimely call presaged something\\nsensational and therefore sinister.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be frightened,\" he said cheerfully, knowing how essential it was\\nthat she should not be startled into an exclamation which might betray\\nher secret to the listening servants. \"I heard from Dacre last night\\nthat you meant to meet Mr. Willard in New York, and I have reason to\\nbelieve that you ought to depart by the first train. To do that, you\\nmust get away from the house in forty minutes. Can you manage it?\"\\n\\nShe came nearer, seeking the truth in his warning eyes, carrying a brave\\nfront before the maids, but with fear in her heart, because she and her\\nlover had eaten of the forbidden fruit, and now they were as gods,\\nknowing good and evil.\\n\\n\"Mr. Dacre!\" she repeated. \"I suppose Mary Van Ralten told him what I\\nsaid. But I don\\'t quite understand. Why should I hurry my departure?\"\\n\\nNothing in this that anyone might hear and deem significant. Power\\nlaughed, as though her air of slight alarm had amused him.\\n\\n\"Come into the veranda,\" he said. \"You are not afraid of the morning\\nair, and it is not on my conscience that I have robbed you of an hour\\'s\\nsleep, since you were up and around before I arrived.\"\\n\\nWhen they were alone, though shut off from inquisitive ears by\\nwire-screen doors only, he said, in a low voice:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say anything that will cause comment, but your father arrived at\\nthe Ocean House soon after midnight, and means to be here about nine\\no\\'clock. Our train leaves at seven. Will you use your own carriage, or\\nshall I send a cab in half an hour? You will be ready, of course?\"\\n\\nNancy was not of that neurotic type of womankind which screams or\\nfaints in a crisis. \"Y-yes,\" she murmured. \"In less time, if you wish.\"\\n\\n\"No need to rush things,\" he said coolly. \"He is not to be called till\\neight. I heard him give the order.\"\\n\\n\"You _heard_ him!\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Thanks to Dacre, when he arrived I was sitting in the veranda,\\nwell hidden, as it happened; so I planned to reach you this morning with\\na couple of hours in hand.\"\\n\\n\"But, Derry, I have a note written, and ready for the post. I can\\'t\\nexplain now----\"\\n\\n\"Put the note in your pocket, and deal with the new situation at\\nleisure. There\\'s only one thing I regret----\"\\n\\n\"Regret! Oh, Derry, what is it?\" And again the shadow of fear darkened\\nher eyes, eyes of that rare tint of Asiatic blue known as blende Kagoul,\\na blue darker at times than any other, and again, bright, dazzling, full\\nof promise, rivaling the clear sky on a summer\\'s night.\\n\\n\"That I dare not take you in my arms and kiss you,\" he said. \"You look\\nuncommonly pretty in that negligee wrap.\"\\n\\nShe blushed, and put up a hand to reassure herself lest her hair might\\nbe tumbling out of its coils. Then she ran to the screen doors and\\npushed them apart.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t wait another second,\" she said. \"Please send that cab. Our own\\nmen will hardly be at the stables yet.\"\\n\\nShe waved a hand and vanished. Her hurried orders to the domestics came\\nin the natural sequence of things, and caused no surprise. When she\\ndrove away from the house at twenty minutes of seven every member of her\\nestablishment believed that Mrs. Marten had gone to join her father in\\nNew York, but, for some reason communicated by her \"cousin,\" was\\ntraveling by the first train of the day instead of the second. The only\\nperplexed person left in \"The Breakers\" was Julie, the French maid, who\\nthought she would find a holiday in Newport dull, and was, moreover,\\ngenuinely concerned because of the scanty wardrobe which her mistress\\nhad taken.\\n\\nOddly enough, Power, waiting with stoic anxiety outside the New York,\\nNew Haven & Hartford station, shared some part of Julie\\'s thought when\\nhe saw Nancy\\'s two small steamer trunks and a hatbox.\\n\\n\"Well!\" he cried, helping her to alight. \"Here have I been worrying\\nabout the capacity of the cab to hold your baggage, and you bring less\\nthan I!\"\\n\\n\"Pay the man,\" she said quietly. Then, under cover of the approach of a\\nporter with a creaking barrow, she added, \"I am coming to you penniless\\nand plainly clad as ever was Nancy Willard. You wish that, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"You dear!\" he breathed; but she had her full answer in the color that\\nsuffused his bronzed face and the light that blazed in his eyes.\\n\\nHe had experienced no difficulty in securing the small coupe of a\\nPullman car to Boston. In that train there was little likelihood of any\\nchance passenger recognizing them. In actual fact, they had the whole\\ncar to themselves. Nancy, who could not banish the notion that the whole\\nworld was watching her, was nervous and ill at ease until the train\\npulled out of the station. She even started and flushed violently when\\nthe conductor came to examine their tickets, whereupon the man smiled\\ndiscreetly and Power laughed.\\n\\n\"You\\'re the poorest sort of conspirator,\" he said, when the door was\\nclosed on the intruder. \"We had better admit straight away that we\\'re a\\nhoneymoon couple, because everybody will know it the instant they look\\nat you.\"\\n\\nBut he failed to charm away the terror that oppressed her spirit. She\\nfelt herself a fugitive from some unseen but awful vengeance, and her\\nheart quailed.\\n\\n\"Derry,\" she said, almost on the verge of tears, \"I\\'m beginning to be\\nafraid.\"\\n\\n\"Afraid of what?\"\\n\\nSomehow, despite his utter lack of experience of woman\\'s ways, he had\\nguessed that this moment would arrive, and was, to that extent, prepared\\nfor it.\\n\\n\"Of everything. I--I know that I alone am to blame. It is not too late\\nfor you to draw back.\"\\n\\n\"Why do you think I might wish to draw back?\"\\n\\n\"Because of the horrid exposure you must face in the near future.\"\\n\\n\"My only trouble is that I may not bear your share as well as my own,\\nNancy. The combined burden would lie light as thistledown on my\\nshoulders. Let us be true to ourselves, and it will surprise you to find\\nhow readily the world, our world, will accept our view.\"\\n\\n\"In your heart of hearts, Derry, do you believe we are doing right?\"\\n\\n\"When ethics come in at the door love flies out by the window. We are\\nrighting a grievous wrong, and, although our actions must, for a time,\\nbe opposed to the generally accepted code of morals, I do honestly\\nbelieve that this is a case in which the end justifies the means.\"\\n\\n\"If I were stronger, Dear, we might have kept within stricter bounds.\"\\n\\n\"You might have gone to Reno, for instance, and qualified for a divorce\\nby residence?\"\\n\\n\"Something of the sort.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take you to Reno, if you like; but I\\'m going with you. Don\\'t\\nforget that he who has begun has accomplished half. Why are you\\ntorturing yourself, little woman? Shall I tell you?\"\\n\\n\"I wish you would.\"\\n\\n\"Because,\" and his arms were thrown around her, and he kissed away the\\ntears trembling on her lashes, \"because, like me, you are really afraid\\nlest we may be too happy. But life is not built on those lines, Deary.\\nIt would still hold its tribulations if we could set the calendar back\\nto an April night of three years ago, and you and I were looking forward\\nwith bright hope to half a century of wedded joy, with never a cloud on\\nthe horizon, and never a memory of dark and deadly abyss crossed in the\\nbygone years. Let us, then, not lose heart in full view of the one\\nthreatening storm. Let us rather rejoice that we are facing it together.\\nThat is how I feel, Nancy. I have never loved you more than in this\\nhour, and why should I repine because of the greatest gift God can give\\nto man, the unbounded love and trust of the one woman he desires? You\\nare mine, Nancy, mine forever, and I will not let you go till I sink\\ninto everlasting night.\"\\n\\nAfter that, an interlude, when words were impossible, else both would\\nhave sobbed like erring children. At last Nancy raised her eyes, and\\nsmiled up into her lover\\'s face, and he understood dimly that, when a\\nwoman\\'s conscience wages war with her emotions, there may come a speedy\\nend to the unequal strife.\\n\\n\"Derry,\" she whispered, \"have you realized that I don\\'t know where you\\nare taking me?\"\\n\\nSo the battle had ceased ere it had well begun. Perhaps she was hardly\\nconscious--if she were, she gave no sign--of the crisis dissipated by\\nthat simple question. It closed with a clang the door of retreat.\\nHenceforth they would dree their weird hand in hand. They would look\\nonly to the future, and stubbornly disregard the past. Shutting\\nrebellious eyes against a mandate written in letters of fire, they would\\nseek comfort in Herrick\\'s time-serving philosophy:\\n\\n  \"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,\\n    Old Time is still a-flying;\\n  And this same flower that smiles today\\n    Tomorrow will be dying.\"\\n\\nThe train slackened speed. They were nearing a wayside station, and they\\ndrew apart in confusion like a pair of lovers surprised in some quiet\\ncorner. But Power laughed softly, and Nancy caught a new note of content\\nin his voice.\\n\\n\"A nice thing!\" he cried. \"The girl is safe aboard the lugger, and I\\ndon\\'t even tell her to what quarter of the globe she is being lugged.\\nBut the sailing directions are easy. We breakfast at Boston. Don\\'t you\\ndare say you cannot eat any breakfast!\"\\n\\n\"I can, or I shall, at any rate,\" she retorted bravely.\\n\\n\"Then Boston will be the best place on earth at nine o\\'clock. Afterward\\nwe take the Burlington road, and cross Lake Champlain. There\\'s a\\nfirst-rate hotel on the west shore, and we stay there tonight. Tomorrow\\nwe plunge into the Adirondacks, and lose ourselves for as long as we\\nplease. How does that program suit my lady?\"\\n\\n\"Whither thou goest----\" she said, and her eyes fell.\\n\\nThus did they thrust dull care into the limbo of forgetfulness, and if\\nthere was standing at the gates of their Eden a frowning angel with a\\ndrawn sword, their vision was clouded, and they could not see him.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAmerica rises early, even in holiday-making Newport; so Mr. Francis\\nWillard did not breakfast in solitary state. When he entered the\\ndining-room at half-past eight next morning he cast a quick glance\\naround the well-filled tables, and ascertained instantly that the one\\nman whom he did not wish to see was absent.\\n\\nToward the close of the meal he beckoned the head waiter.\\n\\n\"Where does Mr. Power sit usually?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"Over there, sir, with Mr. Dacre, the English gentleman, at the small\\ntable near the second window.\"\\n\\nFollowing directions, Willard noted a good-looking man, apparently about\\nforty years old, who was studying the menu intently.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"
