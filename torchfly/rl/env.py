        reset
        render
        close
        seed

        action_space: The Space object corresponding to valid actions
        observation_space: The Space object corresponding to valid observations
        reward_range: A tuple corresponding to the min and max possible rewards
    Note: a default reward range set to [-inf,+inf] already exists. Set it if you want a narrower range.
    The methods are accessed publicly as "step", "reset", etc...
